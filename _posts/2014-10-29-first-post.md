This is probably my fifth attempt at starting a blog. Just the whole process of setting up Wordpress, themes, and dealing with the plugins was too much of a pain. This time, I decided to do away with Wordpress or any other CMS and use a static page generator, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"), hosted on Github-Pages (soon moving to Amazon S3). That seems to be in vogue right now. It makes sense, since I don't really need a database and a $10/month web hosting plan to host a simple blog and resume.
