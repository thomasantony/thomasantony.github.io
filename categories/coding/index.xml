Though I have been thinking of blogging about my experience since the start, it didn’t really happen till now. I am currently wrapping up Project #3 — “Behavioral Cloning”. This one was considerably tougher than the first two. However, it has been very fulfilling to finally complete it and here I will describe the approach I used for training a neural network to drive a car (in a simulator).</description></item><item><title>flybywire — Declarative GUIs for Python inspired by React</title><link>https://www.thomasantony.com/2016/flybywire-declarative-gui-python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2016 05:26:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thomasantony.com/2016/flybywire-declarative-gui-python/</guid><description>Source: xkcd#970 by Randall Monroe
Python is amazing. I love the flexibility, the clean and readable syntax and its huge ecosystem of libraries. However, when it comes to making modern GUIs, it comes up sort in many ways.
There are libraries like PyQT and Kivy to create GUIs for your Python application. However, each of them come with their own problems. Many modern UI solutions like Electron and React-Native looks to the web to avoid the problems of dealing with multiple platforms.</description></item></channel></rss>
