  <h1>Optical Cavity Induced Current</h1>
  <article><p>This is a new experimental result<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Casimir-cavity-induced conductance changes" href="https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.L022007">1</a> that seems to violate the second law of thermodynamics. The author claims to have “captured” zero-point energy and created a device that can continuously generate a 20 nA/10mV current seemingly out of nothing. </p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>My very rudimentary understanding of this device is as follows. When you have two metal plates very close to each other (&lt; 1 micron), they experience a force trying to pull them towards each other, called the “Casimir force” or <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect">“Casimir effect”</a>. This is supposed to happen because it “restricts the wavelengths” between the plates (wavelengths of what?).</p>
<p><img src="/assets/optical-cavity-current/casimir-effect.png" alt="casimir-effect.png" /></p>
<p>The author<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Garret Moddel | Electrical, Computer & Energy Engineering | University of Colorado Boulder" href="https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/garret-moddel">3</a> claims that his device is able to “capture” this energy using a metal-insulator-metal diode, effectively violating the 2nd law of thermodynamics. This is a device that (timestamp 16:52 in <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Unlocking Zero-Point Energy" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGRhTXKh8A">2</a>) allows electrons to “tunnel through” an insulator and get captured Âon the other side while not allowing them to flow back. The author claims that if such a device is exposed to some kind of radiation, it causes thermal electrons to flow across the barrier in <em>both</em> directions resulting in no net flow. Adding the “casimir cavity” on one side however, will restrict the wavelengths on that side, thereby causing a net-flow of electrons in a direction towards the cavity (19:15 in <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Unlocking Zero-Point Energy" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGRhTXKh8A">2</a>). </p>

<p>He claims that the devices produce 70W/sq.m . I will have to learn more about this if I am to understand this further and read the charts/grpahs he has made.</p>
<h2 id="skepticism">Skepticism</h2>
<p>If this turns out to be real, the implications are massive. </p>
<p>However, as with any such claim, I view this with skepticism. The author doesn’t seem like one of those crazy “free-energy” youtubers, but independent reproduction and verification is required. And as with the EMDrive, this may end up being nothing. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p>
<p>While the author<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Garret Moddel | Electrical, Computer & Energy Engineering | University of Colorado Boulder" href="https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/garret-moddel">3</a> is a professor at UCBoulder, his CV<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/moddel-cv">4</a> detailing a whole lot of “parapsychology” stuff does not inspire confidence. His video<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Unlocking Zero-Point Energy" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGRhTXKh8A">2</a> also involves a bit of blaming “mainstream science” and some victimhood which doesn’t lend credence to his position. Maybe I am being a bit too harsh here. </p>
<p>I wonder how difficult/expensive it will be to reproduce this result.</p>
