Orbiter has been around since the early 2000s and it seems like some of the documentation for add-on development is a bit out-dated. This post is my attempt to document how to get an Orbiter 2016 addon development environment set-up in Windows 10, using tools available today (in 2020).
Download Orbiter 2016 Download and install Orbiter following instructions at http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/download.html. &amp;ldquo;TexFilms&amp;rdquo; on Youtube has a very good video detailing how to install Orbiter 2016 along with some essential add-ons.</description></item><item><title>Hello World!</title><link>https://www.thomasantony.com/2019/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2019 20:47:55 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.thomasantony.com/2019/hello-world/</guid><description>Yes. I have started a blog &amp;hellip; again. This is probably my fourth attempt at creating a personal website. And as usual, I spent several hours looking at themes/templates before finally settling on this one.
The intention of this blog is to share my thoughts and ideas on programming, engineering, spaceflight, and pretty much anything that catches my fancy. To whoever is reading this, welcome!</description></item></channel></rss>
