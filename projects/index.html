  <h1>Projects</h1>
  <article><p>This page will list some of my projects and log my progress self-studying different topics of interest to me.</p>
<h3 id="self-study-classical-mechanics">Self Study â€“ Classical Mechanics</h3>
<p>Go to <a href="/projects/sicm-workbook"><strong>Workbook</strong></a></p>
<p>I am currently in the process of studying classical mechanics using <em><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://tgvaughan.github.io/sicm/">Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics</a></em> (aka SICM) by Gerald Sussman and Jack Wisdom. This is part of working towards my eventual goal of properly understanding the math behind General Relativity. Once I am done with SICM, I will move on to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/functional-differential-geometry"><em>Functional Differential Geometry</em></a> (aka FDG) by the same authors. I have taken a couple of courses on Classical Mechanics and Variational Calculus while in gradschool. But this is the first book on the subject that I have found to be engaging while also explaining the concepts really well. I am hoping that the GR book will be similarly elucidating on the subject.</p>
<p>The key factor that sets aside SICM (and FDG) from other textbooks is that it uses computer programs as a way to present its ideas. Expressing the concepts in a computer language (in this case, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>), forces the author to be precise and unambiguous. The authors have written a library called <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/installation.html">scmutils</a> that is required for implementing the methods presented in the book while working through it. </p>
<p>Sam Ritchie has made a Clojure version of <code>scmutils</code> called <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sicmutils/sicmutils">sicmutils</a>. This is what I will be using, along with <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter">CloJupyter</a> to create Jupyter notebooks with notes and exercises. As I complete the exercises and notes, I will be converting them to markdown/html and uploading them to this site.</p>
