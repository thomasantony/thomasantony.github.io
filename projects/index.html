        <h2 id="classical-mechanics"><span>Self Study â€“ Classical Mechanics</h2>
        <div><p>Go to <a href="/projects/sicm-workbook"><strong>Workbook</strong></a></p>
<p>I am currently studying classical mechanics using <em><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://tgvaughan.github.io/sicm/">Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics</a></em> (aka SICM) by Gerald Sussman and Jack Wisdom. This is part of working towards my eventual goal of properly understanding the math behind General Relativity. Once I am done with SICM, I will move on to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262019347/functional-differential-geometry/"><em>Functional Differential Geometry</em></a> (aka FDG) by the same authors. I have taken a couple of courses on Classical Mechanics and Variational Calculus while in gradschool. But this is the first book on the subject that I have found to be engaging while also explaining the concepts really well. I am hoping that the GR book will be similarly elucidating on the subject.</p>
<p>The key factor that sets apart SICM (and FDG) from other textbooks is that it uses computer programs as a way to present its ideas. Expressing the concepts in a computer language (in this case, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>), forces the author to be precise and unambiguous. The authors have written a library called <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/installation.html">scmutils</a> that is required for implementing the methods presented in the book while working through it. Sam Ritchie has made a Clojure version of <code>scmutils</code> called <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sicmutils/sicmutils">sicmutils</a>. This is what I used to create my workbooks, along with along with <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter">CloJupyter</a>.</p>
<p>With all that said, I still find a few spots where a step is missing or it is not entirely clear how the authors came to a certain conclusion. In these cases, I think it is important to note it down, so that it can be a reference for me (and others) in the future. To this end, I will be publishing my notes and exercise solutions <a href="/projects/sicm-workbook">here</a>. These are Jupyter notebooks converted into markdown and then to HTML. The formatting may not be perfect, but it is better than nothing.</p>
