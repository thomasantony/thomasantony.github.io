  <article><h2 id="1-10-2-derivative-constraints">1.10.2 Derivative Constraints</h2>
<p>In this section we look at a specific type of velocity-dependent constraints, which are “total-time derivatives” of a velocity independent function. The methods in <a href="/projects/sicm-workbook/sicm-1.10.1-coordinate-constraints">Section 1.10.1</a> do not apply here as the constraint is velocity-dependent.</p>
<p>Let this constraint $\psi = 0$ be a velocity-dependent constraint. If $\psi$ is a total-time derivative, this means that there exists some <em>velocity-independent</em> function, $\varphi$ such that:</p>
<div>
    $$
\psi \circ \Gamma[q] = D(\varphi \circ \Gamma[q])
$$
</div>
<p>Since $\varphi$ is velocity independant, $\partial_2 \varphi = 0$. The relationship between $\psi$ and $\varphi$ can be restated (as local-tuple functions) as:</p>
<div>
    $$
\psi = D_t \varphi = \partial_0 \varphi + \partial_1 \varphi \dot{Q}\tag{1.214}
$$
</div>
<p>We can find $\psi$ by solving this PDE. The constraint is defined as $\psi = 0$. This implies that $\varphi = K$ for some constant $K$. Conversely, if we know that $\varphi = K$, then $\psi = 0$ follows. <strong>Thus, the velocity-dependent constraint, $\psi = 0$ is equivalent to the velocity-independent constraint, $\varphi = K$</strong>. </p>
<p>If $L$ is the unconstrained Lagrangian, the Lagrange equations with the constraint $\varphi = K$ are:</p>
<div>
    $$
\mathscr{E}[L] \circ \Gamma[q] + \lambda(\mathscr{E}[\varphi] \circ \Gamma[q]) = 0\\
$$
</div>
<p>where $\lambda$ is a function of time that will be eliminated during the solution process. $K$ can be ignored here as $\lambda(\varphi - K)$ and $\lambda(\varphi)$ result in the same Lagrange equations. The function $\varphi$ is independent of velocity and $\partial_2 \varphi = 0$. So we can use the same techniques from Section 1.10.1 to get the Lagrange equations for the system as:</p>
<div>
    $$
\mathscr{E}[L] \circ \Gamma[q] - \lambda(\partial_1 \varphi \circ \Gamma[q]) = 0\\
$$
</div>
<p>From Eq. 1.214, we can also infer that $\psi$ is the partial of $\varphi$ w.r.t velocity, or $\partial_2 \psi = \partial_1 \varphi$. Therefore, the Lagrange equations with the constraint $\psi = 0$ can also be written as:</p>
<div>
    $$
\mathscr{E}[L] \circ \Gamma[q] - \lambda(\partial_2 \psi \circ \Gamma[q]) = 0\tag{1.218}
$$
</div>
<p>This is important because it shows that we can write the Lagrangian in terms of $\psi$ without having to compute $\varphi$, <em>as long as we can show that $\varphi$ exists</em>. </p>
<p>We can also get the same result using the Augmetned Lagrangian technique. Consider the augmented Lagrangian below </p>
<div>
    $$
L&#x27; = L + \lambda&#x27; \psi\\
$$
</div>
<p>The Lagrange equations for $L’$ are:</p>
<div>
    $$
\mathscr{E}[L&#x27;] \circ \Gamma[q] = -D\lambda (\partial_2 \varphi \circ \Gamma[q]) \tag{1.218}
$$
</div>
<p>where $D\lambda’ = \lambda$. This shows that Eq. 1.218 and Eq. 1.219 are the same equations.</p>
<p>The technique defined in this section can be used for systems with constraints that can be written in terms of the derivative of a <em>velocity-independent constraint</em>. Such constraints are called <em>integrable constraints</em>. Any system where the constraints are coordinate constraints, or can be put in the form of a coordinate constraint are called <strong>holonomic constraints</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1.10: A massive hoop rolling, without slipping, down an inclined plane.</strong></p>
<p>“Goldstein’s hoop” is an example of a dynamic system with an integrable constraint: a hoop of mass $M$ and radius $R$ rolling down a one-dimensional inclined plane (Figure 1.10). This problem can be formulated in terms of two coordinates, $\varphi$, the angular displacement of an arbitrary point on the hoop from some arbitrary reference line, and $x$, the linear progress of the center of the hoop down the plane. The cojnstraint is that the hoop rolls without slipping, or in other words, the change is $\theta$ is directly reflected a change in $x$. The constraint function is:</p>
<div>
    $$
\psi(t; x,\theta; \dot{x},\dot{\varphi}) = R\dot{\theta} - \dot{x} = 0\\
$$
</div>
<p>This constraint is represented as a relation between generalized velocities, which can be integrated to get $x = R\theta + c$. This integrated constraint is a velocity-independent constraint. The augmented Lagrangian can be formulated in terms of the original constraint or its derivative.</p>
<p>The kinetic energy consists of the energy of rotation of the hoop (described later in Chapter 2 as $\frac{1}{2}MR^2\dot{\theta}^2$) and the energy from the motion of its center of mass. The potential energy of the system decreses as the hoop proceeds down the slope. Thus the augmented Lagrangian is:</p>
<div>
    $$
L(t; x,\theta,\lambda; \dot{x},\dot{\theta},\dot{\lambda}) = \frac{1}{2}MR^2\dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2}M\dot{x}^2 - (-Mg x\sin\varphi) + \lambda(R\dot{\theta} - \dot{x})\tag{1.122}
$$
</div>
<p>Lagrange equations for this Lagrangian can be obtained as:</p>
<div>
    $$
\begin{align*}
M D^2x - D\lambda &amp;= Mg \sin\varphi \tag{1.223}\\
M R^2 D^2\theta + R D\lambda &amp;= 0 \tag{1.224}\\
R D\theta - Dx &amp;= 0 \tag{1.225}\\
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>Differentiating the third equation, we get </p>
<div>
    $$
R D^2\theta = D^2 x\tag{1.226}
$$
</div>
<p>Multiplying Eq. 1.223 by R and adding with Rq. 1.224</p>
<div>
    $$
\begin{align*}
0 &amp;= M R D^2x - \cancel{RD\lambda} - M R g \sin\varphi
 + M R^2 D^2\theta + \cancel{R D\lambda} \\
 &amp;= \cancel{M} \cancel{R} D^2x - \cancel{M} \cancel{R} g \sin\varphi + \cancel{M} R^\cancel{2} D^2\theta \\
 &amp;= D^2x + R D^2\theta - g \sin\varphi \\
 &amp;= 2 D^2x - g\sin\varphi \\
=&gt; D^2x &amp;= -\frac{1}{2}g\sin\varphi \tag{1.227}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
<p>This acceleration is just half of what the acceleration would have been for a point mass sliding down a frictionless inclied plane. Also notable is that the acceleration is independent of both $M$ and $R$. From the Lagrange equations, $D\lambda$ can be interepreted as the frictional force that is causing the hoop to roll instead of slide. Combining Eq. 1.223 and Eq. 1.227, this force can be found to be:</p>
<div>
    $$
D\lambda = \frac{1}{2} Mg \sin\varphi\tag{1.228}
$$
</div>
<p>and the angular acceleration $D^2\theta$ is:</p>
<div>
    $$
-\frac{1}{2}\frac{g}{R}\sin\varphi\tag{1.229}
$$
