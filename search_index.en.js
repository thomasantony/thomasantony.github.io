The author claims to have “captured” zero-point energy and created a device that can continuously generate a 20 nA/10mV current seemingly out of nothing. \nDescription\nMy very rudimentary understanding of this device is as follows. When you have two metal plates very close to each other (&lt; 1 micron), they experience a force trying to pull them towards each other, called the “Casimir force” or “Casimir effect”. This is supposed to happen because it “restricts the wavelengths” between the plates (wavelengths of what?).\n\nThe author3 claims that his device is able to “capture” this energy using a metal-insulator-metal diode, effectively violating the 2nd law of thermodynamics. This is a device that (timestamp 16:52 in 2) allows electrons to “tunnel through” an insulator and get captured Âon the other side while not allowing them to flow back. The author claims that if such a device is exposed to some kind of radiation, it causes thermal electrons to flow across the barrier in both directions resulting in no net flow. Adding the “casimir cavity” on one side however, will restrict the wavelengths on that side, thereby causing a net-flow of electrons in a direction towards the cavity (19:15 in 2). \n\nHe claims that the devices produce 70W/sq.m . I will have to learn more about this if I am to understand this further and read the charts/grpahs he has made.\nSkepticism\nIf this turns out to be real, the implications are massive. \nHowever, as with any such claim, I view this with skepticism. The author doesn’t seem like one of those crazy “free-energy” youtubers, but independent reproduction and verification is required. And as with the EMDrive, this may end up being nothing. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\nWhile the author3 is a professor at UCBoulder, his CV4 detailing a whole lot of “parapsychology” stuff does not inspire confidence. His video2 also involves a bit of blaming “mainstream science” and some victimhood which doesn’t lend credence to his position. Maybe I am being a bit too harsh here. \nI wonder how difficult/expensive it will be to reproduce this result.\nSee also\n\nMinimal Fab\n\nReferences\n[1] “Optical-Cavity-Induced Current”, Garret Moddel, Ayendra Weerakkody, David Doroski and Dylan Bartusiak, PDF\n[5] “Casimir-cavity-induced conductance changes”, Garret Moddel, Ayendra Weerakkody, David Doroski and Dylan Bartusiak, Physical Review Research 3, L022007, PDF\n","id":"https://thomasantony.com/notes/202108111516-optical-cavity-induced-current/","title":"Optical Cavity Induced Current"},"https://thomasantony.com/notes/202108111837-minimal-fab/":{"body":"I started investinating this after discovering the Optical Cavity Induced Current paper on Hackernews.

The almight algorithm recommended a video1 that describes how to make a “bed of nails” tester for PCBs. The “bed-of-nails” consists of a circuit board with pogo-pins at each contact point for the candidate PCB to be tested. The candidate PCB will be loaded with firmware that listens for input on each GPIO pin, I2C/SPI/Serial port etc. and sends back a pre-determined response. The tester is a simple microcontroller that listens for a serial command, sends a probing signal via the pogo-pins and transmits the response back over serial. The whole system is controlled by a script running on a computer (Raspberry pi?) that programs the target board with the test firmware, sends the commands to the tester and verifies the responses.\nThe production test procedure would involve pressing down the test article and clamping it down somehow on the pogo pins, and running the test script which returns a PASS/FAIL response.\nReferences\n[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gicoRcQYhlA\n","id":"https://thomasantony.com/notes/202108121143-how-to-test-pcbs-bed-of-nails/","title":"How to test PCBs using a bed-of-nails test fixture"},"https://thomasantony.com/notes/202108121759-gps-under-instrument-flight-rules/":{"body":"GPSes certified under TSO-C129 and C196 are non-WAAS and TSO-C145 and C146 are WAAS augmented GPSes.

If the number is odd, then there was at least one bit flip in the message. However this method does not allow detection of two (or an even number) of bit flips. So if the parity in the received message is even, it could mean that there were either no transmission errors or that the message had an even number of errors.\nReferences\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8jsijhllIA\n\n","id":"https://thomasantony.com/notes/202108162030-parity-check/","title":"Parity Check"},"https://thomasantony.com/notes/202108162031-how-do-hamming-codes-work/":{"body":"\nIronically, the ideas that most profoundly shape the way a future generation thinks will end up looking, to that future generation, simpler than they really are ~ Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown)\n\nHamming code is an error correction system that can be used to correct a single error in a message or detect the presence of two errors. This is more advanced version of Parity Check which can recover the original message if there was only a single error/bit-flip during transmission.\nAssume the following 16-bit message packet with the positions numbered as shown. \n[ 0  1  2  3]\n[ 4  5  6  7]\n[ 8  9 10 11]\n[12 13 14 15]\n\nHamming code effectively involves a series of parity checks that narrows down position of the error (if there is one). It can also detect the presence of two errors but not correct for it.\nIn bit#1, store the parity bit for the even columns with bits [1, 5, 9, 13] and [3, 7, 11, 15]. Bit#2 holds parity information for the right two columns. These two combined, specify the column with the error.\nBit#4 similarly holds parity information for the even rows and bit#8 holds parity information for the lower two rows. These two bits combined, specify the row containing the error, effectively locating the position of the error which can then be removed by flipping the bit.\nIf all four parity checks pass, then either the message is error free or it has an error in bit#0. This is because the checks said there is no error in even columns, last two columns, even rows and last two rows, leaving just the first row and column. To account for this, we could just ignore bit#0, resulting in 11 bits of information and 4 bits of check bits -&gt; a (15, 11) Hamming Code.\nTo add double error detection capability, bit#0 could also hold the parity bit for the whole message. If there is a single bit error, the parity of the whole block will fail which can then get corrected by the other bits. However if there are two errors, the whole-message parity check will pass while the error correction using the remaining bits will still indicate the presence of an error. This would indicate the presence of at least two errors in the message. This is called an Extended Hamming Code. \nSo in summary, the message packet holds 11 bits of data and 5 bits of parity bits. \nSee Also\n\nParity Check\nElegance of Hamming Codes\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8jsijhllIA\n\n","id":"https://thomasantony.com/notes/202108162031-how-do-hamming-codes-work/","title":"How Do Hamming Codes Work?"},"https://thomasantony.com/notes/202108162211-elegance-of-hamming-codes/":{"body":"In 202108162031_how-do-hamming-codes-work, we went over how hamming codes can be used to detect and correct single error messages or detect (but not correct) the presences of two or more errors in  a message. However, while the implementation may have seemed complicated, it is actually very elegant and simple.\nIf the parity checks passing/failing is denoted as zero or one, it literally spells out the position of the error in binary. For example if the parity check failed (a.k.a is odd) for all but the last one, then the position is 0111b, or bit#7. The following description explains why this happens.\nAssume the same 16-bit message as the last article, except with each index represented in binary instead:\n[ 0000  **0001**  **0010**  0011]\n[ **0100**  0101  0110  0111]\n[ **1000**  1001  1010  1011]\n[ 1100  1101  1110  1111]\n\nWhen checking if the even columns pass parity, what we are really checking is this question:\n“If there is an error, is the last bit of its position index a 1?”. This is because the positions in these two columns all have the last bit equal to one. Similarly the other parity checks follow through for the other bits of the error position. This is the reason for the parity bits being places where they are. At those position indices, the only a single bit is “on”. \nA note on XOR\nThe XOR operation in binary is essentially “add mod 2”. This is also equivalent to a parity check as XOR returns one for an odd number of ones and zero for an even number of ones.\nHamming code using XOR\nEach column/row being checked can be XORed with each other to get the parity check. So the way to do all four parity checks at once, is to take the positions of all the ones in the message and XOR them together to get the position of the error. Each bit in a position index is denoting what parity group it is part of. \nFor example, if bit#3 and bit#15, part of the last column are ones, then we XOR 0011 and 1111 resulting in 1100. This means if these were the only ones in the message, parity group “1” and “2”, or even columns and the last two columns have parity of zero, the rows checks have odd parity.\nPython Implementation\nIf bits is a numpy array of zeros and ones.\nfrom functools import reduce\nimport numpy as np\nimport operator\n\nbits = np.random.randint(0, 2, 16)\nparity = reduce(operator.xor, [i for i, bit in enumerate(bits) if bit]) \n\n# Set parity bits\nif (parity &amp; 0b1000):\n    bits[parity &amp; 0b1000] = not bits[parity &amp; 0b1000]\nif (parity &amp; 0b0100):\n    bits[parity &amp; 0b0100] = not bits[parity &amp; 0b0100]\nif (parity &amp; 0b0010):\n    bits[parity &amp; 0b0010] = not bits[parity &amp; 0b0010]\nif (parity &amp; 0b0001):\n    bits[parity &amp; 0b0001] = not bits[parity &amp; 0b0001]\n\n# Parity will now be zero\nassert(reduce(operator.xor, [i for i, bit in enumerate(bits) if bit])==0)\n\n# Add error\nbits[10] = not bits[10]\n\nassert(reduce(operator.xor, [i for i, bit in enumerate(bits) if bit])==10)\n\nPractical Usage\nHamming codes offer single error correction with only log(N) bits for an N-bit message block. Message blocks may be overlapping to make this more robust against burst errors.

I was directed to this reference by a user on the SmashTheStack Discord server after I was stuck on level 2 of the “amateria” CTF challenge.\nPremise\nThe challenge involved a constantly running privileged server that would accept connections and spawn a child process, which would in turn prompt for a username and password. If they username matched “level3” it would spawn a “level3” privileged shell while the level2 username/password would spawn a level2 shell. There was also a hint in the README saying there was a script that mimiced a user with valid credentials using the service. The wording of this hint led me to believe that there was an existing privileged session that I was supposed to take over. But in fact, it was much simpler than that. The script in question would hit the service at a certain (frequent) interval and send the correct username and password for level 3. If we could take over the listening socket, we could intervene and capture this information when the script connects.\nProcedure\nThe idea is that child processes inherit any file descriptors opened by the parent process unless a special flag is set. So we open a session as “level2” (whose credentials are available). Then we run  a python script that opens up the original listen socket using the file descriptor number, 3. This is 3 because 0, 1 and 2 correspond to stdin, stdout and stderr. We can use socket.socket(fileno=3) to accomplish this (only in Python3). Afterwards, we can use it as if it is any other listen socket, accept connections, read incoming data and respond as if we are the original service.\nRemedy\nThe parent process must set the FD_CLOEXEC flag on the privileged file descriptor to prevent the child processes from accessing them.\n#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;\n\nfcntl(fd,FD_CLOEXEC);\n\nReferences\n[1] http://www.phearless.org/istorija/razno/fdleak.txt\n","id":"https://thomasantony.com/notes/202108302000-how-to-steal-file-descriptors-fdleak/","title":"How to steal file descriptors aka fdleak"},"https://thomasantony.com/notes/202111122106-what-is-the-gamma-function/":{"body":"The gamma function is a generalization of the factorial to complex numbers.

The macro looks something like this:\n#[macro_export]\nmacro_rules! ctype_wrapper {\n    ($r:ident, $c:ty) =&gt; {\n        /// Newtype wrapper for a `$c` \n        #[derive(Debug, Eq, Clone, PartialEq, Hash, Default, Copy)]\n        #[allow(non_camel_case_types)]\n        #[repr(transparent)]\n        pub struct $r(pub $c);\n        unsafe impl cxx::ExternType for $r {\n            type Id = cxx::type_id!($r);\n            type Kind = cxx::kind::Trivial;\n        }\n    };\n    ($r:ident, $c:ty, $nice_name:ident) =&gt; {\n        /// Newtype wrapper for a `$c`\n        #[derive(Debug, Eq, Clone, PartialEq, Hash, Default, Copy)]\n        #[allow(non_camel_case_types)]\n        #[repr(transparent)]\n        pub struct $r(pub $c);\n        unsafe impl cxx::ExternType for $r {\n            type Id = cxx::type_id!($r);\n            type Kind = cxx::kind::Trivial;\n        }\n        type $nice_name = $r;\n    };\n}\n\nThe macro has two variants that are almost the same. They generate a newtype wrapping the given underling type and also implements the cxx::ExternType trait for it allowing to pass it by value to/from C++ code. The variant with 3 arguments can be used to create a type alias for at the same time.

Example, for “WEARY”, there is some number of words that do not contain any of the letters, some that contain W, some with W and E, some with E at the first position, etc.\nWe can geenrate the list of all possible outcomes for a given word, and check how many words in the list match the patterns to come up with a probability.\nKey A guess is “informative” if it is unlikely, i.e., the more unlikely the  pattern, the fewer possibilities remain to be checked. A highly unlikely guess, if correct, significantly cuts down the solution space.\nThe expected amount of information from the distribution for a certain word is \n$$\nE[\\text{Information}] = \\sum_x {p(x) \\cdot \\text{Something}}\n$$\nThis “something” should measure how informative that pattern is. We could try to lower the average number of matches. The fewer the number of matches for a pattern, the more informative that pattern is. Instead we can use a concept from information theory.\nWhat is a “bit”?\nAn observation that can cut the space of possibilities in half, that is called a bit of information.\nTherefore\np(1 bit) = 1/2\np(2 bits) = 1/4\np(3 bits) = 1/8 etc.\n\nOr, for information $I$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^I = p \\implies 2^I = \\frac{1}{p}\\\nI = \\log_2{\\left(\\frac{1}{p}\\right)}\n$$\nThis is a better way of representing probability. You can say that you get 20 bits of information instead of saying that the probability of such a thing occuring is 0.00000095.\nInformation (or bits) add together the same way probabilities multiply, thanks to the logarithm.\nApplying information theory to the problem\n$$\nE[\\text{Information}] = \\sum_x {p(x) \\cdot \\log_2{\\left(\\frac{1}{p(x)}\\right)}\n}\n$$\nThis is the average number of bits you could get from a  certain word. The higher the probability of seeing a pattern, the lower the number of bits.\nThis metric can be used to rank the guess in order of number of expected bits of information.\nNote:\n**This expected value of information is also called “entropy” ($H$). This was a suggestion by von Neumann to Claude Shannon. While this has some connection to the entropy from thermodynamics, Shannon was dealing purely with probability distribution when he used the term. **\nStrategy\nFirst give a guess based on the word that gives the highest expected number of bits of information. Then for the next guess use the more restricted list of words based on the result of the first guess, and so on.\nThe solver can be run across every single word in the word-list to work out an average score.\nA better strategy?\nAssign a probability for each word for being in the final list based on frequency of use in the English language instead of a uniform distribution. Grant ranks them by frequency and uses a sigmoid function to assign probabilities. Use this to measure the “remaining uncertainty” of the possible word candidates left. So even if the number of possible words is higher, the uncertainty would be lower thanks to the weighted distribution. \nExpected Score\nTBD.\nReferences\n[1] The mathematically optimal Wordle strategy, 3Blue1Brown\n","id":"https://thomasantony.com/notes/202201061105-solve-wordle-using-information-theory/","title":"Solve Wordle Using Information Theory"},"https://thomasantony.com/notes/202202192208-running-virtualbox-vms-with-networking/":{"body":"Run the VMs with “Host-Only Networking”.

It works by using an electric motor to spin a flywheel that causes the spacecraft to rotate in the opposite direction. A set of three orthogonally arranged reaction wheels can fully control the spacecraft attitude. In an isolated system, a reaction wheel assembly (RWA) can be used indefinitely without requiring any energy input other than power for the motors. However, disturbance torques add energy into the system, causing the angular momentum of the wheels to increase. When they get saturated, some other source of torque, such as RCS thrusters or torque-rods need to be used to desaturate them.\nTorque allocation to a 3-wheel system can be accomplished by projecting the torque vector to each individual spin axis via a dot product. With more than three wheels, the added degrees of freedom results in an infinite number of possible solutions. The optimal solution in this case is picked by one of the following strategies. More generalized strategies are available for allocating torques in systems with more than three reaction wheels [1].\nReferences\n[1] Section 4.3.8, “Fundamentals of Spacecraft Attitude Determination and Control”, Markley, F.

The advantage of using this representation is that it makes addition of negative numbers possible with existing binary adder circuits (or logic gate implementation). The reason this works is that the output we get from an adder circuit is actually the “modulo 2^n” representation. \nExample: -2 + -3 using 4-bit integers\n-2 in 2’s complement is 2^4 - 2 = 16-2 = 14 or 0b1110\n-3 in 2’s complement is 2^4 - 3 = 16-3 = 13 or 0b1101\nPerforming binary addition of 0b1110 and 0b1101 we get, 0b1011 and a carry bit of 1 which is discarded. 0b1011 is 11 in decimal.

Different combinations of input flags results in one of the 18 operations described above.\nThe two extra outputs zr and ng are set based on the characteristics of the final output. This ALU design is specific to the “Hack” computer being developed as part of this course. Other computers may have more options implemented in the ALU.

Combinational chips compute functions that depend solely on combinations of their input values.\nSequential logic incorporates the concept of time, or more specifically, discretized time in the form of a clock signal into determining their output. This is the core concept behind digital circuits with memory. Just like how NAND formed the basic building blocks of combinational logic, the “D-Flip-Flip” is the fundamental building block used to build sequential logic. A D-Flip-Flop can be built out of nand-gates using a loop-based design but that is beyond the scope of the course.\nClocked Data Flip Flop (D Flip-Flop or DFF)\nThe D Flip-Flop has one input “in” and one output “out”. There’s also an implicit “clock” signal that cycles from high to low and back to high to make a single “clock cycle”. The output of the D flip-flip is simply the input of the last time step (with the output of the initial timestep being indeterminate).\nD-Flip-Flops are combined in various ways with combinational logic circuits to build up basic memory units like a 1-bit register, larger addressed registers (RAM) and counters that form the basis of computer memory.\nOne-Bit Register\nA bit regsiter has two inputs “in” and “load” and a single output “out”. The output is the same as the last output if “load” is zero. It is equal to “in” if “load” is set to one. The HDL imlementation uses a Mux to select between the lastOutput and the current input. This is then passed into a DFF and the output of the DFF is the output of the register.\nMux(a=lastOutput, b=in, sel=load, out=dffIn);\nDFF(in=dffIn, out=out, out=lastOutput);\n\nThe output of the DFF is fanned out to the input of the Mux as well. This is possible because HDL is not a programming language. It can be thought of as a description of electrical wiring. So the output line of the DFF is looped back to the input of the Mux here.\n16-bit register\nA 16-bit register chip has a 16-bit input in, a single bit load input and a 16-bit output, out. This can be implemented by stacking 8 one-bit register and fanning out the load input to all of them. The inputs and outputs of each “bit” chip is wired to the individual bits of in and out respectively.\nRAM8 chip\nThis is a chip that can store 8 “words” (in this case 16-bit words). The chip has a 16-bit in input, 3-bit address  input and a 16-bit output, out. It uses a Demuxer to split out the address into 8 different load bits which are then fed into Register chips. in is fanned out to all the underlying Register chips. The outputs of the registers are then connected to the out pin through a Multiplexer with the address as its selector. \nRAM64, RAM512, RAM4K and RAM16K\nThese are built in the same manner as RAM8 but by composing RAMx chips using a Demuxer and Muxer. RAM64 has a 6-bit address input, where the 3 most-significant bits select the underlying RAM8 chip and the 3 LSBs signify the address in the underlying RAM8. Therefore the load bit is wired to the RAM8 chips through a Demuxer with address[3..5] as the sel input and address[0..2] is passed through directly to the underlying chips. The output is similarly muxed using address[3..5] as the selector. The higher capacity chips are built in the same way by stacking 4 or 8 lower capacity chips and an appropriately sized Demuxer and Muxer.\n","id":"https://thomasantony.com/notes/202208041236-nand2tetris-note-04-sequential-logic-and-memory/","title":"NAND2Tetris Note 04 - Sequential Logic and Memory"},"https://thomasantony.com/notes/202208042109-nand2tetris-note-05-hack-assembly-language/":{"body":"The “Hack” computer built during this course has its own instruction set consisting of two instructions: the A-command and the C-command.\nRegisters\nA -&gt; address.

I love the flexibility, the clean and readable syntax and its huge ecosystem of libraries. However, when it comes to making modern GUIs, it comes up sort in many ways.\nThere are libraries like PyQT and Kivy to create GUIs for your Python application. However, each of them come with their own problems. Many modern UI solutions like Electron and React-Native looks to the web to avoid the problems of dealing with multiple platforms. After all, the web is one platform that DOES have it’s share of great (and at times awful) UIs.\nflybywire is my ongoing experiment to develop a declarative UI library, based off some great work by Cristian Medina. So, what is flybywire all about? Well, you need a bit of background before I can go into that.\nReact, ES6 and the Endless&nbsp;Abyss\nReact caught my interest sometime late last year when I was trying to build a desktop frontend for a Python project using Electron. I was coming back to web development after a gap of nearly six years and my last experience in the field was with jQuery and PHP.\nAfter finishing a basic tutorial, I was really excited about the possibilities of React. However, that excitement was a little dulled once I discovered the wonderful world of node-based tools that seemed almost mandatory if you wanted to create anything serious. I found that javascript is no longer the innocent, interpreted language I knew it as. ES6, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, transpilers, webpack, the endless abyss that is node-packages&nbsp;… it is easy to get lost just trying to get a hang of all these tools and frameworks.\nSo where am I going with all this? Well, my (mis?)adventures with React, Redux etc. can be summarized as:\n\nReact seems to have zeroed in on a really good way of defining UIs without much clutter. I especially loved the concept of one-way binding and views defined as pure functions of state which redraws the whole page when updated.\nI found redux to be a great addition to the React ecosystem that provides clean and predictable state management along with some very fancy debugging features.\nA Python programmer who wants to use React or Electron still has to navigate through the very confusing tooling (npm, webpack, babel etc.) before they can even start to create anything useful.\nI don’t want to deal with Javascript to design my UI.\n\nThere has to be a way to do all this in Python!\nThe Magic of Websockets\nLast week, I came across this article which seemed to reflect many of the problems that I had faced when it came to Python GUIs. The article is part of a 3-part (so far) series that ends with the creation of Sofi (Cheers Cristian!). As described in the article, Sofi is:\n\na system that will generate the necessary HTML and JavaScript code typically needed to produce a single-page application and serve it up through WebSockets\n\nThough it is at a very early stage in its design, Sofi seems to do what it is supposed to. It allows you to design UIs in Python while leveraging web technologies like Bootstrap to render them. One thing I did not like about Sofi was the imperative nature of the UI design which reminded me of jQuery (and maybe a bit of Java AWT). After my experience with React, I wanted something declarative and functional.\nSo, is it possible to leverage websockets to implement something that keeps the general idea behind Sofi, but is declarative and functional like React?\nflybywire\nflybywire is my ongoing experiment based on Sofi to create a more declarative UI library. It re-renders the page every time the state changes. It uses a virtual-dom system similar to that used by React, to only update those parts of the page that have actually changed. The coding style in flybywire applications was modeled after that of React. The library includes a helper function that allows components to be defined in a syntax inspired by JSX.\nUsage\nBelow is a really simple demo app that is included with the library:\nA simple counter app made using flybywire\nAnd this is counter.py.\nfrom flybywire.core import App  \nfrom flybywire.dom import h\n\ndef CounterView(count):  \n    \"\"\"A simple functional stateless component.\"\"\"  \n    return h('h1', str(count))\n\nclass CounterApp(App):  \n    def \\_\\_init\\_\\_(self):  \n        \"\"\"Initialize the application.\"\"\"  \n        super().\\_\\_init\\_\\_()  \n        self.set\\_initial\\_state(0)\n\ndef render(self):  \n        \"\"\"Renders view given application state.\"\"\"  \n        return h('div',  \n                    \\[CounterView(count=self.state),  \n                     h('button', '+', onclick = self.increment),  \n                     h('button', '-', onclick = self.decrement)\\]  \n                )\n\ndef increment(self, e):  \n        \"\"\"Increments counter.\"\"\"  \n        self.set\\_state(self.state + 1)\n\ndef decrement(self, e):  \n        \"\"\"Decrements counter.\"\"\"  \n        self.set\\_state(self.state - 1)\n\napp = CounterApp()  \napp.start()\n\nHow it&nbsp;Works\nThe structure of the code above should be very familiar to anyone who has worked with React before. flybywire provides a helper function for building DOM structures. It is also possible to compose the UI out of stateless, functional components (like CounterView in the above example). This DOM structure is then converted into JSON format and sent to the browser over websockets using the autobahn library. The javascript part of the library parses the virtual-DOM structure out of the JSON data and patches the existing DOM wherever it has changed. Any DOM event callbacks are also setup to be passed back to the Python app over websockets.\nSome of the core parts of this library such as the event server and event processor were directly taken from Sofi with a few modifications. Instead of Bootstrap-based widgets, flybywire allows you to define your own components that can be composed to form whatever widget you need.\nIt is now possible to make some really simple apps using flybywire. However, the library is at a very early stage, given that the First Commit in the repository was only three days ago!\nWhat doesn’t&nbsp;work\nHere’s some things that are missing and/or acts weird:\n\nSome basic manipulations of the DOM elements such as focusing a particular input box or clearing the input box after a certain action is completed are currently not possible. This will probably require putting back some of the command system from Sofi that I had removed when making flybywire. This can also possibly be fixed by moving to a platform like Electron which may give greater control over the rendering process.\nThe server shuts down as soon as you close the browser window. This is done on purpose as there is currently no way to reset the application state without restarting the server. The shared state also results in weird behavior if you open multiple windows. Once we move to a platform like Electron, flybywire will have hopefully have more fine control over the life cycle of the application.\n\nComing Soon\nI will probably add a few more features over the weekend, particularly a better Component class for creating stateful components. Any suggestions/comments/ideas and constructive criticism are welcome!\n","id":"https://thomasantony.com/posts/2016/tantony-flybywire-declarative-guis-for-python-inspired-by-react-ad2131d4cbc1/","title":"flybywire — Declarative GUIs for Python inspired by React"},"https://thomasantony.com/posts/2016/tantony-training-a-neural-network-in-real-time-to-control-a-self-driving-car-9ee5654978b7/":{"body":"I was lucky enough to be accepted into the first cohort of Udacity’s Self Driving Car NanoDegree program back in October. Though I have been thinking of blogging about my experience since the start, it didn’t really happen till now. I am currently wrapping up Project #3 — “Behavioral Cloning”. This one was considerably tougher than the first two. However, it has been very fulfilling to finally complete it and here I will describe the approach I used for training a neural network to drive a car (in a simulator).\n\nThe project description makes it looks easy (relatively). In the first project, we detected lanes using some basic Computer Vision methods and in the second, we classified traffic signs from the German Traffic Signs dataset. The third one seemed like an extension of the second, where instead of classifying traffic signs, we had to predict steering angles based on a camera feed, using a neural network.\nCollecting Training&nbsp;Data\nUnlike Project#2, this time we had to collect our own training data. This was more challenging than expected. As it turned out, controlling Udacity’s SDC simulator with a keyboard is not a simple task. Feedback from other students on Slack seemed to indicate that it also gave bad, jittery steering angle data. Fortunately, I have a friend who is crazy about car racing games and owns a Logitech G27 Racing wheel.\n\nUdacity’s SDC Simulator\nFor training data, I recorded data (“camera” images + steering angle and other telemetry) where I drove through the two tracks a couple of times. I also recorded data while recovering from deliberate perturbations to the sides of the lane to make sure the neural net also learned how to recover from such situations.\nPicking the Architecture and Training the&nbsp;NN\nI spent a lot of time experimenting with different convolutional neural network architectures, with varying levels of success. I also tried taking existing trained models like VGG16 and Google’s Inception v3 and adapting them to this purpose. Eventually, I settled upon NVIDIA’s End-to-End Deep Learning architecture described in this paper. It was relatively small in size and hence added very little latency when running it. I proceeded to use my gaming desktop with GTX 1070 GPU to train the model on ~32000 images.\nWhat I learned is that “mean square error” was not at all a predictor of the performance of the network in the actual simulator. Another big issue was the turnaround time between collecting data, training the network and then testing it. Also, the ‘remote driving’ script provided by Udacity set the car’s throttle to a constant value with no way to control the speed.\nThat is when I came across John Chen’s post on our Slack channel about how he developed an “Agile Trainer” to reduce the turnaround time between data-collection and testing. His program uses PyGame and Joystick input to manually takeover control from the neural network whenever it deviated too much and also allowed to train the network at the same time.\nI wrote my own live trainer based on this idea, which instead used keyboard input. It turned out that my keyboard based “remote driver” was able to control the simulator more reliably than the simulator’s “Training mode”.\nBest of all, it allowed me to fine-tune the model from my bed with my Macbook Pro by “NoMachine”-ing into my desktop (which would be difficult with a joystick/racing wheel).\nHow it&nbsp;works\nThe live trainer has a Tkinter-based UI and a few simple keyboard controls.\n\nSDC Live Trainer interface\nUp/Down: Control cruise speed\nLeft/Right: Steering\nx: Toggle between autonomous and manual override modes\nc: Center steering (only in manual override mode)\nz: Toggle real-time training (only in manual override mode)\nThe speed of the car is controlled by a proportional-gain controller. It modulates the throttle based on speed feedback. This rudimentary “cruise control” gets the speed within +/- 1 mph of the target speed, which is good enough in this case.\nThe arrow keys increase/decrease the steering angle. The steering also has some slow auto re-centering dynamics added by the trainer. So the steering angle will keep “decaying” towards zero if you don’t press any key. The “autonomous rating” measures what percentage of the current session was spent in fully autonomous mode.\nReal-time training\nThe process of training itself is pretty simple. You can do one of two things:\n\nDeliberately perturb the car’s motion while in manual override and engage training mode once you have started the recovery process\nAt any spots that the model has trouble with, engage training mode while driving through the spot manually to fine-tune the model.\n\nThe GIF below shows an example of the first case. I purposely drive the car towards the right edge using manual override and then start training the model once I have it recovering and returning to the center of the lane.\nEvaluating model performance\nMy initial model had some trouble navigating a couple of turns on track#1 in the simulator. I was able to successfully tune these spots using live training and finally get this result:\nTrack 2 was a little more difficult, with more sharp gradients and curves. However, I found that decreasing the speed down to 20 mph helped it navigate that track as well!\nThe live trainer code is on Github at: thomasantony/sdc-live-trainer\nPossibilities\nA live trainer can also probably be used to perform the initial training of the network, though that would involve a lot more baby-sitting during the training process. The good thing is that you can immediately start seeing results as the model converges toward the right weights.\nIs such an architecture extendable to real-world SDCs? It can definitely be done with scale models on scale tracks. On real cars it is probably a little more difficult (though there are probably ways to do it). NVIDIA’s paper mentions using real-world data to make a simulator. A live training methodology like the one described here can possibly be incorporated into such a simulator as well!\nLet me know if you have any comments/suggestions!\n","id":"https://thomasantony.com/posts/2016/tantony-training-a-neural-network-in-real-time-to-control-a-self-driving-car-9ee5654978b7/","title":"Training a neural network in real-time to control a self-driving car"},"https://thomasantony.com/posts/2018/":{"body":"","id":"https://thomasantony.com/posts/2018/","title":""},"https://thomasantony.com/posts/2018/tantony-using-virtualcan-inside-docker-on-macos-cfa10f7e75d6/":{"body":"At SmartAg, we use Docker to manage the development and runtime environments for our embedded software.

Your docker-machine VM is now ready. It should already be running. If you restart your machine, you can start the VM by typing docker-machine start default or stop it with docker-machine stop default&nbsp;.\n9. Set the environment parameters to use docker with your new VM by running eval $(docker-machine env default)&nbsp;. This command has to be run every time you are in a new terminal. You can also add this to your&nbsp;.bashrc to make it automatic.\n10. Check that it all works:\ndocker run -it --rm --privileged alpine /bin/sh\n\nInside the docker container, run:\nzcat /proc/config.gz | grep CAN\n\nThe command should display the CAN flags that you set while compiling the kernel. SocketCAN/VirtualCAN is now enabled in any docker container that you start on this VM.\nCaveats\nRunning docker using docker-machine means that some things, such as port-forwarding does not work as you expect.

Orbiter-Forum is also a great resource. The rest of the post assumes that Orbiter 2016 is installed in C:\\Orbiter.\nDownload Visual Studio 2019\nDownload the Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition web installer from Visual Studio Download Center. Run the installer and you will eventually see a window with something similar to this:\n\nCheck the option that says “Desktop Development with C++”. You may also modify the install location for the compiler. Continue with the installation and wait for it to complete.\nBuild a sample project\nThe Orbiter SDK is installed in C:\\Orbiter\\OrbiterSdk. The SDK includes some sample projects including custom vehicles and Multi-Functional Displays (MFDs). Open OrbiterSdk\\CustomMFD\\CustomMFD.vcproj in Visual Studio 2019. You will get a prompt asking you if you want to convert the project to make it compatible.\n\nClick “OK” to continue. Switch to the “Property Manager” tab at the bottom of “Solution Explorer”.\n\nWithin Property Manager, expand “CustomMFD” to show two options “Debug | WIn32” and “Release | Win32”. Expand both of these until you get an opton called “Orbiterroot”. Right click this and select Properties. \n\nSelect “User Macros”. Ensure that the “OrbiterDir” variable is set to the correct Orbiter installation path.\n\nSelect “VC++ Directories”. Change the “Include Directories” and “Library Directories” settings as shown in the screenshow below.

If you are running a vanilla Orbiter installation, set this to C:\\Orbiter\\Orbiter.exe instead.\n\nI got this handy tip from Andrew Stokes’ video. Go to C++ &gt; Code Generation in the Property Sheet. Change Runtime Library to “Multithreaded (/MT)” for your “Release” configuration and “Multithreaded Debug (/MTd)” for your “Debug” configuration. This removes an external dependency on Visual Studio Runtime DLL.\n\n\nAt this point, if you hit Build (F7), you may get an error saying:\nRC : fatal error RC1110: could not open CustomMFD.rc\n\nIf this happens, switch back to “Solution Explorer” and delete the CustomMFD.rc file. Now the project should build successfully. It should be noted that the compiler places the output in the C:\\Orbiter\\Modules\\Plugin directory by default. This can be verified by deleting C:\\Orbiter\\Modules\\Plugin\\CustomMFD.dll and rebuilding the project. Ensure that CustomMFD.dll appears in the folder after you build the project. You can now run Orbiter as usual or have Visual Studio start it for you by hitting “Debug”.

Please watch the video for more context. Full source code of Jupyter notebooks implementing the algorithm can be found at thomasantony/msl-apollo-entry-guidance.\nNASA’s Mars Science Laboratory mission showcased an advancement in entry technology that allowed it to land much closer to its designated landing site than previous missions. It used with great success, the same guidance algorithm originally used by the Apollo Command Module when returning from the moon. By modulating its lift vector, MSL was able to counteract errors in its trajectory during hypersonic flight and combined with the famous “sky-crane” maneuver, deliver the Curiosity rover to within 2.5 km of its targeted landing site next to Gale Crater. Last year’s Mars 2020 mission used the same guidance system to successfully land the Perseverance rover within Jezero crater.\nApollo Guidance Algorithm Overview\nThe goal of the Apollo guidance algorithm is to minimize the error in “range” along the ground when compared to that of a pre-computed reference trajectory. It does not try to exactly match the reference trajectory, but instead computes a constant bank angle that is supposed to minimize the downrange distance error at the point where the vehicle reaches terminal altitude. This computation is repeated several times a second in the same manner as a closed-loop control system to correct for deviations in the trajectory due to external or internal factors.\nThe guidance algorithm uses bank angle to control the amount of vertical lift. This has the side-effect of causing lateral motion that takes the spacecraft away from the desired path. In order to account for this, the bank angle commanded is reversed when the predicted cross-range error exceeds a certain amount, effectively creating a series of S-turns. This is similar to the S-turns performed by the Space Shuttle during its re-entry.\nThis article focuses on the downrange error control.\n2DOF Dynamic Model\nThe MSL entry vehicle is modeled in two-dimensions using a vehicle-centric polar coordinate system. The state variables in the model are altidude ($h$), downrange distance ($s$), speed ($v$) and flight path angle($\\gamma$). Their equations of motion are as follows:\n\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\frac{d h}{dt} &amp;= v \\sin{\\gamma} \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\frac{d s}{dt} &amp;= v \\cos{\\gamma}  \\\\\n    \\frac{d v}{dt} &amp;= -{{D/m}} - {{g}} \\sin(\\gamma)  \\\\\n    \\frac{d \\gamma}{dt} &amp;= \\frac{1}{v} \\left(\\frac{v^2 \\cos(\\gamma)}{{{R_M}} + h} + \\frac{L \\cos{u}}{m} - {{g}}\\cos(\\gamma)\\right) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere \n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{D}{m} &amp;= \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2 \\beta} &amp;;&amp; \\text{ Drag Acceleration}\\\\\n\\frac{L}{m} &amp;= \\frac{D}{m}\\enspace (L/D) &amp;;&amp;\\text{ Lift Acceleration}\\\\\n\\nonumber\\\\\n\\rho &amp;= \\rho_0 e^{-h/H} &amp;;&amp; \\text{ Atmosphere Model}\\\\\n\\nonumber\\\\\n\\beta &amp;= 120 \\text{kg/m$^2$} &amp;;&amp; \\text{ Ballistic Coefficient} \\\\\n(L/D) &amp;= 0.24 &amp;;&amp;\\text{ Lift-to-Drag Ratio}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSurface atmospheric density, $\\rho_0$ and scale height, $H$ define the exponential atmospheric model. $g$ is a constant value for acceleration due to gravity. $u$ is the bank angle of the vehicle. The states are collectively referred to as $\\mathbf{x}$. The equations of motions may be collectively referred to as $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}, u, t)$.\nDeriving the Apollo Entry Guidance Algorithm\nNote on the Variation Operator\nThis derivation requires the use of the “variation operator”, denoted by $\\delta$, sometimes called a functional derivative or variational derivative. A functional is a function that acts on functions. For example, $J(y(t))$ is a functional because $y$ is itself a function of time. Here $J$ is a scalar quantity derived from a function $y(t)$, that essentially consists of an infinite number of points. \nThe variational operator is to functionals, what derivatives are to functions. Similar to how a stationary point of a function can be found by setting its derivative to zero, the stationary point of a functional can be found by setting its variation to zero. \nPlease check the following links if you want to learn more:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqDHO2eKXcs\nhttps://canvas.vt.edu/files/1315932/download?download_frd=1\nDeriving bank angle policy\n\nThe goal is to find the constant bank angle $u$ that will guide the spacecraft from the perturbed starting state $\\mathbf{x_0}$ to the same range as the reference trajectory. Let’s call this function $J$. Any variable with an “f” in the suffix denotes that it is evaluated at the terminal point of the trajectory and the ‘*’ denotes that it is part of the reference trajectory.\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\nJ = R_f &amp;= s_f + \\dot{s_f} dt_f = s_f + v_f \\cos(\\gamma_f)  dt_f \\label{eqn:J_1}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nFrom the equations of motion,\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\dot{h_f} &amp;= \\frac{dh_f}{dt_f} \\implies dt_f = \\frac{dh_f}{\\dot{h_f}} \\label{eqn:h_f_expr}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nSubstituting $\\eqref{eqn:h_f_expr}$ in $\\eqref{eqn:J_1}$,\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\nJ &amp;= s_f + \\frac{v_f \\cos(\\gamma_f) }{\\dot{h_f}} dh_f \\\\ \n &amp;= s_f + \\frac{v_f \\cos(\\gamma_f)}{v_f \\sin(\\gamma_f)} dh_f\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nAssuming that the reference trajectory terminates at the ground, we get $dh_f = 0 - h_f = -h_f$\n\n    $$\n\\implies J = s_f - cot(\\gamma_f) h_f = \\Phi(\\mathbf{x}_f)\n$$\n\nWe want to now find a constant value of $u$ that will keep J constant at $J = R_f = R_f^*$ even with perturbations. We are able to control the trajectory by influencing $u$ and are constrained by physics i.e. equations of motion, $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x},u,t)$. These constraints can be adjoined to $J$ using co-states $\\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal = \\left[\\lambda_h\\enspace\\lambda_s\\enspace\\lambda_v\\enspace\\lambda_\\gamma\\right]$, one for each state. This is very similar to Lagrange multipliers used in function optimization. In this case, each costate is a function that has its own equation of motion which will be derived here.\n\n    $$\nJ' =  \\Phi(\\mathbf{x}_f) + \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal(t) \\left\\{ \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x},u, t) - \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\right\\} dt\n$$\n\nTo find the stationary point of $J$ we apply the variation operator. We also shorten $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x},u, t)$ to just $\\mathbf{f}$.\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\delta J' &amp;= \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}\\delta \\mathbf{x}\\bigg|_{t=t_f}  + \\delta \\left[ \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal(t) \\left\\{ \\mathbf{f} - \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}) \\right\\} dt \\right] \\nonumber\\\\\n&amp;= \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}\\delta \\mathbf{x}\\bigg|_{t=t_f}  + \\delta \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\bigg[ \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal(t) \\mathbf{f} - \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal(t)\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\bigg] dt \\nonumber\\\\\n&amp;= \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}\\delta \\mathbf{x}\\bigg|_{t=t_f}  + \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\delta \\big[ \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal(t) \\mathbf{f} \\big] - \\delta\\big[\\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal(t)\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\big] dt  \\nonumber\\\\\n&amp;= \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}\\delta \\mathbf{x}\\bigg|_{t=t_f}  + \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\delta \\big[ \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal(t) \\mathbf{f} \\big] - \\delta\\big[\\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\big] dt \n\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nApplying the chain rule to the variation operator\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\delta J' &amp;= \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}\\delta \\mathbf{x}\\bigg|_{t=t_f}  + \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal \\delta \\mathbf{f} + \\delta\\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal \\mathbf{f} - \\delta\\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal(t)\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} - \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal\\delta\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} \\enspace\\enspace dt  \\label{eqn:Jprime_1}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nApplying Leibniz Rule to the first term of the integral in ${\\eqref{eqn:Jprime_1}}$,\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal \\delta \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}, u, t)\\enspace dt = \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\mathbf{\\lambda^\\intercal} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} \\delta\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{\\lambda^\\intercal} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{u}} \\delta\\mathbf{u}\\enspace dt \\label{eqn:Jprime_int_term1}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nIntegrating by parts, the fourth term of the integral in ${\\eqref{eqn:Jprime_1}}$,\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal(t)\\enspace\\delta\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\enspace dt &amp;= \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\frac{d}{dt}\\big( \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal \\delta \\mathbf{x} \\big) dt - \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\dot{\\mathbf{\\lambda}}(t)\\enspace\\delta x \\enspace dt \\\\\n&amp;= \\bigg[ {\\lambda}^\\intercal \\delta \\mathbf{x} \\bigg]_{t_0}^{t_f} - \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\dot{\\mathbf{\\lambda}}(t)\\enspace\\delta x \\enspace dt \\label{eqn:Jprime_int_term4}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nSubstituting $\\eqref{eqn:Jprime_int_term1}$ and $\\eqref{eqn:Jprime_int_term4}$ in ${\\eqref{eqn:Jprime_1}}$,\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\delta J' &amp;= \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}\\delta \\mathbf{x}\\bigg|_{t=t_f}  + \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\mathbf{\\lambda^\\intercal} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} \\delta\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{\\lambda^\\intercal} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{u}} \\delta\\mathbf{u}  + \\delta\\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal \\overbrace{\\left(\\mathbf{f} - \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\right)}^{= 0} \\enspace dt - \\bigg[ {\\lambda}^\\intercal \\delta \\mathbf{x} \\bigg]_{t_0}^{t_f} + \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\dot{\\mathbf{\\lambda}}(t)\\enspace\\delta x \\enspace dt \\\\\n\n\\delta J' &amp;= \\bigg[\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} - \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal\\bigg)\\delta \\mathbf{x}\\bigg]_{t=t_f}  + \\left( \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal \\delta \\mathbf{x} \\right)\\bigg|_{t=t_0}+ \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\delta\\mathbf{x}(\\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}  + \\dot{\\mathbf{\\lambda}}) \\enspace dt + \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{u}} \\delta\\mathbf{u} \\enspace dt\\label{eqn:Jprime_2}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nSet $\\delta J’ = 0$ to find the stationary point of $J’$.

However this can be very expensive (especially considering the hardware this was originally designed for). So we differentiate (34) w.r.t $t_0$ and apply Leibniz Rule to get\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial \\lambda_u}{\\partial t_0} &amp;= -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}^\\intercal \\mathbf{\\lambda}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThe boundary condition for $\\lambda_u$ can be obtained as :\n\n    $$\n\\lambda_u(t_0=t_f) = \\int_{t_f}^{t_f}-\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}^\\intercal \\mathbf{\\lambda}\\enspace dt = 0\n$$\n\nApollo Guidance Bank Angle Policy\nWhen we actually implement this guidance algorithm, $t_0$ and $\\mathbf{\\mathbf{x}_0}$ corresponds to the “current” time and state of the spacecraft. All the $\\delta{\\mathbf{x}}$ values are therefore computed by comparing the current trajectory to the reference trajectory. For example, \n$\\delta h(v_0) = h(v_0) - h^{*}(v_0)$ \nwhere $h(v_0)$ is the current altitude and $h^*(v_0)$ is the altitude on the reference trajectory corresponding to the current speed. \nPutting it all together, $\\eqref{eqn:delu_1}$ becomes\n\n    $$\n\\delta u =  -\\frac{\\frac{-H\\lambda_h^*(v_0)}{(D/m)^*(v_0)}\\delta((D/m) (v_0)) + \\lambda_s^*(v_0) \\delta s(v_0) +  \\frac{\\lambda_\\gamma^*(v_0)}{v_0^* \\cos{(\\gamma(v_0))}}\\delta\\dot{h}(v_0)}{\\lambda_u^*(v_0)}\n$$\n\nThe terms containing $*$ can be pre-computed on the ground along with teh reference trajectory. These terms can therefore be substituted by:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\nF_1(v_0) &amp;= \\frac{H \\lambda_h^*(v_0)}{\\frac{D}{m}^*(v_0)}\\\\\nF_2(v_0) &amp;= \\frac{\\lambda_\\gamma^*(v_0)}{v_0^* \\cos{\\gamma^*(v_0)}} \\\\\nF_3(v_0) &amp;= \\lambda_u^*(v_0)\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nAlso, it can be found that $\\lambda_s$ has a constant value of 1 since $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{s}}{\\partial s} = 0$ and $\\lambda_s(t_f) = 1$. \nSo the final expression for $\\delta u$ becomes:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\delta u =  \\frac{- \\delta s(v_0) -F_1(v_0) \\delta(\\frac{D}{m} (v_0))  - F_2 (v_0) \\delta\\dot{h}(v_0)}{F_3(v_0)}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n$\\delta u$ is added to the reference bank angle $u$ to obtain the bank angle to be commanded in each guidance cycle.\nSome Notes on Implementation\nOne key bottleneck that I found during implementation was the data-lookup within the reference trajectory data. Right now, the reference trajectory data is stored in a 2D numpy array. In every guidance cycle, we do a lookup within this array to find the data row with the closest value of velocity to the vehicle’s current velocity. This could be made much more efficient with a better data structure.\nConclusion\nThe Jupyter notebooks implement the algorithm as well as a Monte Carlo simulation system for testing it. I will be updating them to add more notes and details on the implementation to clarify things further.\nReferences\n[1] R.D.Braun and R.M.

I previously took a stab at this back in 2020 with limited success. I was much less knowledgeable about Rust at the time and the tooling around C++ bindings were not as mature then. This post is a companion to this new repository that contains a proof-of-concept for building a spacecraft addon for Orbiter in Rust.\nWhy Rust?\nRust is a relatively new high level systems programming language with a focus on safety. Orbiter is written in C++ and therefore its addons are also typically written in C++. Rust development for Orbiter is facilitated using the cxx crate.\nDesign\nThe repository in its current form produces a DLL file as its build artifact that can be loaded into Orbiter as an addon module. Anyone wanting to create a Rust addon will clone/fork the repository and build it along with the the Rust code for their addon.(See update below). \nThere are a limited number of Orbiter SDK functions currently available as Rust bindings in this prototype.\nThis will expand in the future to hopefully encompass the majority of the API. The repository includes a demo addon that models NASA’s Surveyor probe. This follows from the C++ tutorial at OrbiterWiki and implements retro-thruster staging and differential thrust attitude control.\nDeveloping custom spacecraft addons\nUpdate 01/11/2022: This section has been changed to reflect changes to the crate\nAll the spacecraft-specific code in the repository lives in its own file (src/shuttle_pb.rs for example).\nAn addon crate implementing a spacecraft should import the orbiter_rs crate. It should then set its crate-type to cdylib. \n[package]\nname = \"shuttlepb\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"Thomas Antony\"]\nedition = \"2018\"\n\n[lib]\ncrate-type = [\"cdylib\"]\n\n[dependencies]\norbiter_rs = { version = \"0.1\", path = \"/path/to/orbiter-rs\" }\n\nThe crate should then have a lib.rs containing a struct that implements the OrbiterVessel trait. It should then use the init_vessel macro as shown below. This macro generates a stub that is links the Rust code to the OrbiterSDK. For example, in lib.rs:\nuse orbiter_rs::{\n    ODebug, OrbiterVessel, VesselContext, _V, init_vessel, FileHandle\n};\n\n#[derive(Default, Debug)]\npub struct ShuttlePB {\n    _some_param: i32\n}\n\nimpl OrbiterVessel for ShuttlePB {\n    fn set_class_caps(&amp;mut self, context: &amp;VesselContext, _cfg: FileHandle) {\n        context.SetSize(1.0);\n        context.SetPMI(_V!(0.50, 0.50, 0.50));\n        context.AddMesh(\"ShuttlePB\".to_string());\n    }\n}\n\ninit_vessel!(\n    fn init(_h_vessel: OBJHANDLE, _flight_model: i32) -&gt; ShuttlePB\n    {\n        ShuttlePB::default()\n    }\n    fn exit() {}\n);\n\nThe addon may use any of the wrapped functions currently available. Any other Orbiter SDK functions will require wrappers to be generated for them. An automated tool like autocxx may be worth investigating for this purpose.\nBuilding and Installing\nThe addon can be built using cargo build assuming that Visual Studio 2019 is available. Other C++ compilers may or may not work. Deploying the addon also requires a config file and any meshes and other dependencies. An example can be seen in Config/Surveyor.cfg. Once you build the addon, the DLL will be available in the target/i686-pc-windows-msvc/debug folder. This will need to be renamed to match whatever module name you haev in the configuration file.\nSummary\nThis proof-of-concept gives a basic framework for building Orbiter addons in Rust. It is not a complete system by any metric and will require significant amounts of work before it can be considered that.\n","id":"https://thomasantony.com/posts/orbiter-addon-rust/","title":"Orbiter Addon Development in Rust"},"https://thomasantony.com/projects/":{"body":"","id":"https://thomasantony.com/projects/","title":"Projects"},"https://thomasantony.com/projects/classical-mechanics/":{"body":"Go to Workbook\nI am currently studying classical mechanics using Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics (aka SICM) by Gerald Sussman and Jack Wisdom.

But this is the first book on the subject that I have found to be engaging while also explaining the concepts really well. I am hoping that the GR book will be similarly elucidating on the subject.\nThe key factor that sets apart SICM (and FDG) from other textbooks is that it uses computer programs as a way to present its ideas. Expressing the concepts in a computer language (in this case, Scheme), forces the author to be precise and unambiguous. The authors have written a library called scmutils that is required for implementing the methods presented in the book while working through it. Sam Ritchie has made a Clojure version of scmutils called sicmutils. This is what I used to create my workbooks, along with along with CloJupyter.\nWith all that said, I still find a few spots where a step is missing or it is not entirely clear how the authors came to a certain conclusion. In these cases, I think it is important to note it down, so that it can be a reference for me (and others) in the future. To this end, I will be publishing my notes and exercise solutions here. These are Jupyter notebooks converted into markdown and then to HTML. The formatting may not be perfect, but it is better than nothing.\nReferences\n\nStructure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics, Gerald J.

There are apparently four degrees of freedom for two massive particles in the plane, but the rigid rod reduces this number to three.\nWe can uniquely specify the configuration with the redundant coordinates of the particles, say $x_0(t)$, $y_0(t)$ and $x_1(t)$, $y_1(t)$. The constraint $(x_1(t) − x_0(t))^2 + (y_1(t) − y_0(t))^2 = l^2$ eliminates one degree of freedom.\nFigure 1.5:\n\na. Write Newton’s equations for the balance of forces for the four rectangular coordinates of the two particles, given that the scalar tension in the rod is $F$.\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\nm_0 \\ddot{x}_0 &amp;= F \\cos\\theta = F \\frac{x_1 - x_0}{l}\\\\\nm_0 \\ddot{y}_0 &amp;= F \\sin\\theta = F \\frac{y_1 - y_0}{l}\\\\\nm_1 \\ddot{x}_1 &amp;= -F \\cos\\theta = -F \\frac{x_1 - x_0}{l}\\\\\nm_1 \\ddot{y}_1 &amp;= -F \\sin\\theta = -F \\frac{x_1 - x_0}{l} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nb.

There is also a conserved quantity associated with the symmetry (Section 1.8). However, there are general symmetries that no coordinate systems can fully express. For examplem, motion around a central potential is spherically symmetric, i.e., the dynamical system is invariant under rotation about any axis. However, the Lagrangian for this system only demonstrates symmetry about a single axis. \nIn general, a Lagrangian is said to have a symmetry if there exists a coordinate transformation that leaves the Lagrangian unchanged.\nIn this section we consider the more general case of continous symmetries. A continuous symmetry is defined as a parametric family of symmetries. Emmy Noether proved that for any continuous symmetry, there is a conserved quantity.\nConsider a parametric coordinate transformation, $\\widetilde{F}$ with parameter $s$. This means that $\\widetilde{F}$ represents an infinite number of coordinate transformations, one for each value of $s$. \nAn example would be a function that takes an angle, $s$, as the input and spits out a coordinate transformation that rotates the primed coordinate frame, $x’$ about some axis by that angle.\n\n    $$\nx = \\widetilde{F}(s) (t, x')\n$$\n\nThere is a corresponding parametreic state transformation $\\widetilde{C}$ associated with $\\widetilde{F}$ that transforms the velocity $v’$ as well the time (i.e. the local tuple that forms the input to the Lagrangian).\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n(t, x, v) &amp;= \\widetilde{C}(s) (t, x', v') \\\\\n          &amp;= (t, \\widetilde{F}(t,x'),  \\partial_0 \\widetilde{F} + \\partial_1 \\widetilde{F} v', ...)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nWe require that $\\widetilde{F}(0)$ represent the identity transformation $x’ = \\widetilde{F}(0)(t, x’)$, with $\\widetilde{C}$ as the corresponding identity state transformation. If the Lagrangian $L$ has a continous symmetry corresponding to $\\widetilde{F}$, then the Lagrangian should be unchanged when the coordinates are transformed using $\\widetilde{F}$. Therefore:\n\n    $$\n\\widetilde{L}(s) = L\\cdot \\widetilde{C}(s) = L\\quad\\text{for any }s\n$$\n\nExpanding $\\widetilde{C}$ in the above expression, we get:\n\n    $$\n\\widetilde{L}(s) = L\\left(t,\\quad\\widetilde{F}(s)(t, x'),\\quad\\partial_1\\widetilde{F}(s)(t, x')v' \\right)\\\\\n$$\n\nUndoing the “chainrule” in the second term and writing it in terms of the total time derivative,\n\n    $$\n\\widetilde{L}(s) = L\\left(t,\\quad\\widetilde{F}(s)(t, x'),\\quad D_t\\widetilde{F}(s)(t, x', v') \\right) \n$$\n\n\nNote: One of the assumptions in the following derivation is that $\\partial_0 L = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial t} = 0$\nThat $\\widetilde{L}(s) = L$ for any $s$ implies that $D\\widetilde{L}(s) = 0$ (where the $D$ operator represents derivative w.r.t $s$). Therefore, applying the chain rule for each of the components of $\\widetilde{L}$, the derivative of $\\widetilde{L}$ w.r.t $s$ is:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &amp;= D\\widetilde({L}(s)(t, x', v'))\\\\\n  &amp;= \\underbrace{\\partial_0 L}_{=\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial t} = 0} + \\partial_1 L(t, x, v) (D\\widetilde{F})(s)(t, x') + \\underbrace{\\partial_2 L(t,x,v) D(D_t\\widetilde{F}(s)(t, x')}_{\\text{can swap }D_t\\text{ and }D\\text{, as }D\\text{ w.r.t }s\\text{ is unstructured}} \\\\\n  &amp;= \\partial_1 L(t, x, v) (D\\widetilde{F})(s)(t, x') + \\partial_2 L(t,x,v) D_t(D\\widetilde{F}(s))(t, x') \\\\ \n  &amp;= (\\partial_1 L \\circ \\Gamma[q]) \\left( (D\\widetilde{F})(s) \\circ \\Gamma[q']\\right) + (\\partial_2 L \\circ \\Gamma[q])\\left( D_t(D\\widetilde{F}(s)) \\circ \\Gamma[q']\\right) \\tag{1.157}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAccording to Lagrange equations, the first term of Eq. 1.157 is: $(\\partial_1 L \\circ \\Gamma[q]) \\left( (D\\widetilde{F})(s) \\circ \\Gamma[q’]\\right) = (D_t\\partial_2 L \\circ \\Gamma[q]) \\left(D\\widetilde{F})(s) \\circ \\Gamma[q’]\\right)$. Substituting this in Eq. 1.157,\n\n    $$\n0 = (D_t \\partial_2 L \\circ \\Gamma[q])\\left( (D\\widetilde{F}(s)) \\circ \\Gamma[q']\\right) +  (\\partial_2 L \\circ \\Gamma[q])\\left( D_t(D\\widetilde{F}(s)) \\circ \\Gamma[q']\\right) \\tag{1.159}\n$$\n\nWhen $s = 0$, since $\\widetilde{F}(0)$ is the identity transformation, the paths $q$ and $q’$ are the same. Therefore, $\\Gamma[q] = \\Gamma[q’]$ and Eq. 1.158 becomes\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n0 &amp;= \\left ((D_t \\partial_2 L)(D\\widetilde{F}(0)) +  (\\partial_2 L)(D_t(D\\widetilde{F}(0)))\\right) \\circ \\Gamma[q] \\\\\n  &amp;= D_t ((\\partial_2 L) (D\\widetilde{F}(0))) \\circ \\Gamma[q] \\tag{1.160}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nTherefore the state function $\\mathscr{I}$:\n\n    $$\n\\mathscr{I} = (\\partial_2 L) (D\\widetilde{F}(0))\n$$\n\nis conserved along all solution trajectories. This quantity is called the Noether integral. It is the product of the momentum $\\partial_2 L$ and a vector associated with the symmetry.\n","id":"https://thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-1-8-5-noethers-theorem/","title":"Section 1.8.5: Noether's Theorem"},"https://thomasantony.com/publications/":{"body":"Journal Articles and Conference Proceedings\n\n\nRapid Indirect Trajectory Optimization on Highly Parallel Computing Architectures\nAntony, T., and Grant, M.
