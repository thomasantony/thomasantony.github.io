The author claims to have “captured” zero-point energy and created a device that can continuously generate a 20 nA/10mV current seemingly out of nothing. \nDescription\nMy very rudimentary understanding of this device is as follows. When you have two metal plates very close to each other (&lt; 1 micron), they experience a force trying to pull them towards each other, called the “Casimir force” or “Casimir effect”. This is supposed to happen because it “restricts the wavelengths” between the plates (wavelengths of what?).\n\nThe author3 claims that his device is able to “capture” this energy using a metal-insulator-metal diode, effectively violating the 2nd law of thermodynamics. This is a device that (timestamp 16:52 in 2) allows electrons to “tunnel through” an insulator and get captured Âon the other side while not allowing them to flow back. The author claims that if such a device is exposed to some kind of radiation, it causes thermal electrons to flow across the barrier in both directions resulting in no net flow. Adding the “casimir cavity” on one side however, will restrict the wavelengths on that side, thereby causing a net-flow of electrons in a direction towards the cavity (19:15 in 2). \n\nHe claims that the devices produce 70W/sq.m . I will have to learn more about this if I am to understand this further and read the charts/grpahs he has made.\nSkepticism\nIf this turns out to be real, the implications are massive. \nHowever, as with any such claim, I view this with skepticism. The author doesn’t seem like one of those crazy “free-energy” youtubers, but independent reproduction and verification is required. And as with the EMDrive, this may end up being nothing. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\nWhile the author3 is a professor at UCBoulder, his CV4 detailing a whole lot of “parapsychology” stuff does not inspire confidence. His video2 also involves a bit of blaming “mainstream science” and some victimhood which doesn’t lend credence to his position. Maybe I am being a bit too harsh here. \nI wonder how difficult/expensive it will be to reproduce this result.\nSee also\n\nMinimal Fab\n\nReferences\n[1] “Optical-Cavity-Induced Current”, Garret Moddel, Ayendra Weerakkody, David Doroski and Dylan Bartusiak, PDF\n[5] “Casimir-cavity-induced conductance changes”, Garret Moddel, Ayendra Weerakkody, David Doroski and Dylan Bartusiak, Physical Review Research 3, L022007, PDF\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/notes/202108111516-optical-cavity-induced-current/","title":"Optical Cavity Induced Current"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/notes/202108111837-minimal-fab/":{"body":"I started investinating this after discovering the Optical Cavity Induced Current paper on Hackernews.

The almight algorithm recommended a video1 that describes how to make a “bed of nails” tester for PCBs. The “bed-of-nails” consists of a circuit board with pogo-pins at each contact point for the candidate PCB to be tested. The candidate PCB will be loaded with firmware that listens for input on each GPIO pin, I2C/SPI/Serial port etc. and sends back a pre-determined response. The tester is a simple microcontroller that listens for a serial command, sends a probing signal via the pogo-pins and transmits the response back over serial. The whole system is controlled by a script running on a computer (Raspberry pi?) that programs the target board with the test firmware, sends the commands to the tester and verifies the responses.\nThe production test procedure would involve pressing down the test article and clamping it down somehow on the pogo pins, and running the test script which returns a PASS/FAIL response.\nReferences\n[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gicoRcQYhlA\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/notes/202108121143-how-to-test-pcbs-bed-of-nails/","title":"How to test PCBs using a bed-of-nails test fixture"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/notes/202108121759-gps-under-instrument-flight-rules/":{"body":"GPSes certified under TSO-C129 and C196 are non-WAAS and TSO-C145 and C146 are WAAS augmented GPSes.

If the number is odd, then there was at least one bit flip in the message. However this method does not allow detection of two (or an even number) of bit flips.

This is more advanced version of Parity Check which can recover the original message if there was only a single error/bit-flip during transmission.\nAssume the following 16-bit message packet with the positions numbered as shown. \n[ 0  1  2  3]\n[ 4  5  6  7]\n[ 8  9 10 11]\n[12 13 14 15]\n\nHamming code effectively involves a series of parity checks that narrows down position of the error (if there is one). It can also detect the presence of two errors but not correct for it.\nIn bit#1, store the parity bit for the even columns with bits [1, 5, 9, 13] and [3, 7, 11, 15]. Bit#2 holds parity information for the right two columns. These two combined, specify the column with the error.\nBit#4 similarly holds parity information for the even rows and bit#8 holds parity information for the lower two rows. These two bits combined, specify the row containing the error, effectively locating the position of the error which can then be removed by flipping the bit.\nIf all four parity checks pass, then either the message is error free or it has an error in bit#0. This is because the checks said there is no error in even columns, last two columns, even rows and last two rows, leaving just the first row and column. To account for this, we could just ignore bit#0, resulting in 11 bits of information and 4 bits of check bits -&gt; a (15, 11) Hamming Code.\nTo add double error detection capability, bit#0 could also hold the parity bit for the whole message. If there is a single bit error, the parity of the whole block will fail which can then get corrected by the other bits. However if there are two errors, the whole-message parity check will pass while the error correction using the remaining bits will still indicate the presence of an error. This would indicate the presence of at least two errors in the message. This is called an Extended Hamming Code. \nSo in summary, the message packet holds 11 bits of data and 5 bits of parity bits. \nSee Also\n\nParity Check\nElegance of Hamming Codes\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8jsijhllIA\n\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/notes/202108162031-how-do-hamming-codes-work/","title":"How Do Hamming Codes Work?"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/notes/202108162211-elegance-of-hamming-codes/":{"body":"In 202108162031_how-do-hamming-codes-work, we went over how hamming codes can be used to detect and correct single error messages or detect (but not correct) the presences of two or more errors in  a message. However, while the implementation may have seemed complicated, it is actually very elegant and simple.\nIf the parity checks passing/failing is denoted as zero or one, it literally spells out the position of the error in binary. For example if the parity check failed (a.k.a is odd) for all but the last one, then the position is 0111b, or bit#7. The following description explains why this happens.\nAssume the same 16-bit message as the last article, except with each index represented in binary instead:\n[ 0000  **0001**  **0010**  0011]\n[ **0100**  0101  0110  0111]\n[ **1000**  1001  1010  1011]\n[ 1100  1101  1110  1111]\n\nWhen checking if the even columns pass parity, what we are really checking is this question:\n“If there is an error, is the last bit of its position index a 1?”. This is because the positions in these two columns all have the last bit equal to one. Similarly the other parity checks follow through for the other bits of the error position. This is the reason for the parity bits being places where they are. At those position indices, the only a single bit is “on”. \nA note on XOR\nThe XOR operation in binary is essentially “add mod 2”. This is also equivalent to a parity check as XOR returns one for an odd number of ones and zero for an even number of ones.\nHamming code using XOR\nEach column/row being checked can be XORed with each other to get the parity check. So the way to do all four parity checks at once, is to take the positions of all the ones in the message and XOR them together to get the position of the error. Each bit in a position index is denoting what parity group it is part of. \nFor example, if bit#3 and bit#15, part of the last column are ones, then we XOR 0011 and 1111 resulting in 1100. This means if these were the only ones in the message, parity group “1” and “2”, or even columns and the last two columns have parity of zero, the rows checks have odd parity.\nPython Implementation\nIf bits is a numpy array of zeros and ones.\nfrom functools import reduce\nimport numpy as np\nimport operator\n\nbits = np.random.randint(0, 2, 16)\nparity = reduce(operator.xor, [i for i, bit in enumerate(bits) if bit]) \n\n# Set parity bits\nif (parity &amp; 0b1000):\n    bits[parity &amp; 0b1000] = not bits[parity &amp; 0b1000]\nif (parity &amp; 0b0100):\n    bits[parity &amp; 0b0100] = not bits[parity &amp; 0b0100]\nif (parity &amp; 0b0010):\n    bits[parity &amp; 0b0010] = not bits[parity &amp; 0b0010]\nif (parity &amp; 0b0001):\n    bits[parity &amp; 0b0001] = not bits[parity &amp; 0b0001]\n\n# Parity will now be zero\nassert(reduce(operator.xor, [i for i, bit in enumerate(bits) if bit])==0)\n\n# Add error\nbits[10] = not bits[10]\n\nassert(reduce(operator.xor, [i for i, bit in enumerate(bits) if bit])==10)\n\nPractical Usage\nHamming codes offer single error correction with only log(N) bits for an N-bit message block. Message blocks may be overlapping to make this more robust against burst errors.

I was directed to this reference by a user on the SmashTheStack Discord server after I was stuck on level 2 of the “amateria” CTF challenge.\nPremise\nThe challenge involved a constantly running privileged server that would accept connections and spawn a child process, which would in turn prompt for a username and password. If they username matched “level3” it would spawn a “level3” privileged shell while the level2 username/password would spawn a level2 shell. There was also a hint in the README saying there was a script that mimiced a user with valid credentials using the service. The wording of this hint led me to believe that there was an existing privileged session that I was supposed to take over. But in fact, it was much simpler than that. The script in question would hit the service at a certain (frequent) interval and send the correct username and password for level 3. If we could take over the listening socket, we could intervene and capture this information when the script connects.\nProcedure\nThe idea is that child processes inherit any file descriptors opened by the parent process unless a special flag is set. So we open a session as “level2” (whose credentials are available). Then we run  a python script that opens up the original listen socket using the file descriptor number, 3. This is 3 because 0, 1 and 2 correspond to stdin, stdout and stderr. We can use socket.socket(fileno=3) to accomplish this (only in Python3). Afterwards, we can use it as if it is any other listen socket, accept connections, read incoming data and respond as if we are the original service.\nRemedy\nThe parent process must set the FD_CLOEXEC flag on the privileged file descriptor to prevent the child processes from accessing them.\n#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;\n\nfcntl(fd,FD_CLOEXEC);\n\nReferences\n[1] http://www.phearless.org/istorija/razno/fdleak.txt\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/notes/202108302000-how-to-steal-file-descriptors-fdleak/","title":"How to steal file descriptors aka fdleak"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/notes/202111122106-what-is-the-gamma-function/":{"body":"The gamma function is a generalization of the factorial to complex numbers.

The macro looks something like this:\n#[macro_export]\nmacro_rules! ctype_wrapper {\n    ($r:ident, $c:ty) =&gt; {\n        /// Newtype wrapper for a `$c` \n        #[derive(Debug, Eq, Clone, PartialEq, Hash, Default, Copy)]\n        #[allow(non_camel_case_types)]\n        #[repr(transparent)]\n        pub struct $r(pub $c);\n        unsafe impl cxx::ExternType for $r {\n            type Id = cxx::type_id!($r);\n            type Kind = cxx::kind::Trivial;\n        }\n    };\n    ($r:ident, $c:ty, $nice_name:ident) =&gt; {\n        /// Newtype wrapper for a `$c`\n        #[derive(Debug, Eq, Clone, PartialEq, Hash, Default, Copy)]\n        #[allow(non_camel_case_types)]\n        #[repr(transparent)]\n        pub struct $r(pub $c);\n        unsafe impl cxx::ExternType for $r {\n            type Id = cxx::type_id!($r);\n            type Kind = cxx::kind::Trivial;\n        }\n        type $nice_name = $r;\n    };\n}\n\nThe macro has two variants that are almost the same.

The variant with 3 arguments can be used to create a type alias for at the same time.

Example, for “WEARY”, there is some number of words that do not contain any of the letters, some that contain W, some with W and E, some with E at the first position, etc.\nWe can geenrate the list of all possible outcomes for a given word, and check how many words in the list match the patterns to come up with a probability.\nKey A guess is “informative” if it is unlikely, i.e., the more unlikely the  pattern, the fewer possibilities remain to be checked. A highly unlikely guess, if correct, significantly cuts down the solution space.\nThe expected amount of information from the distribution for a certain word is \n$$\nE[\\text{Information}] = \\sum_x {p(x) \\cdot \\text{Something}}\n$$\nThis “something” should measure how informative that pattern is. We could try to lower the average number of matches. The fewer the number of matches for a pattern, the more informative that pattern is. Instead we can use a concept from information theory.\nWhat is a “bit”?\nAn observation that can cut the space of possibilities in half, that is called a bit of information.\nTherefore\np(1 bit) = 1/2\np(2 bits) = 1/4\np(3 bits) = 1/8 etc.\n\nOr, for information $I$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^I = p \\implies 2^I = \\frac{1}{p}\\\nI = \\log_2{\\left(\\frac{1}{p}\\right)}\n$$\nThis is a better way of representing probability. You can say that you get 20 bits of information instead of saying that the probability of such a thing occuring is 0.00000095.\nInformation (or bits) add together the same way probabilities multiply, thanks to the logarithm.\nApplying information theory to the problem\n$$\nE[\\text{Information}] = \\sum_x {p(x) \\cdot \\log_2{\\left(\\frac{1}{p(x)}\\right)}\n}\n$$\nThis is the average number of bits you could get from a  certain word. The higher the probability of seeing a pattern, the lower the number of bits.\nThis metric can be used to rank the guess in order of number of expected bits of information.\nNote:\n**This expected value of information is also called “entropy” ($H$). This was a suggestion by von Neumann to Claude Shannon. While this has some connection to the entropy from thermodynamics, Shannon was dealing purely with probability distribution when he used the term. **\nStrategy\nFirst give a guess based on the word that gives the highest expected number of bits of information. Then for the next guess use the more restricted list of words based on the result of the first guess, and so on.\nThe solver can be run across every single word in the word-list to work out an average score.\nA better strategy?\nAssign a probability for each word for being in the final list based on frequency of use in the English language instead of a uniform distribution. Grant ranks them by frequency and uses a sigmoid function to assign probabilities. Use this to measure the “remaining uncertainty” of the possible word candidates left. So even if the number of possible words is higher, the uncertainty would be lower thanks to the weighted distribution. \nExpected Score\nTBD.\nReferences\n[1] The mathematically optimal Wordle strategy, 3Blue1Brown\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/notes/202201061105-solve-wordle-using-information-theory/","title":"Solve Wordle Using Information Theory"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/notes/202202192208-running-virtualbox-vms-with-networking/":{"body":"Run the VMs with “Host-Only Networking”.

It works by using an electric motor to spin a flywheel that causes the spacecraft to rotate in the opposite direction. A set of three orthogonally arranged reaction wheels can fully control the spacecraft attitude. In an isolated system, a reaction wheel assembly (RWA) can be used indefinitely without requiring any energy input other than power for the motors. However, disturbance torques add energy into the system, causing the angular momentum of the wheels to increase. When they get saturated, some other source of torque, such as RCS thrusters or torque-rods need to be used to desaturate them.\nTorque allocation to a 3-wheel system can be accomplished by projecting the torque vector to each individual spin axis via a dot product. With more than three wheels, the added degrees of freedom results in an infinite number of possible solutions. The optimal solution in this case is picked by one of the following strategies. More generalized strategies are available for allocating torques in systems with more than three reaction wheels [1].\nReferences\n[1] Section 4.3.8, “Fundamentals of Spacecraft Attitude Determination and Control”, Markley, F.

The advantage of using this representation is that it makes addition of negative numbers possible with existing binary adder circuits (or logic gate implementation). The reason this works is that the output we get from an adder circuit is actually the “modulo 2^n” representation. \nExample: -2 + -3 using 4-bit integers\n-2 in 2’s complement is 2^4 - 2 = 16-2 = 14 or 0b1110\n-3 in 2’s complement is 2^4 - 3 = 16-3 = 13 or 0b1101\nPerforming binary addition of 0b1110 and 0b1101 we get, 0b1011 and a carry bit of 1 which is discarded. 0b1011 is 11 in decimal.

Different combinations of input flags results in one of the 18 operations described above.\nThe two extra outputs zr and ng are set based on the characteristics of the final output. This ALU design is specific to the “Hack” computer being developed as part of this course. Other computers may have more options implemented in the ALU. This is a design trade-off as to how many operations need to be implemented in hardware as opposed to software. In case of “Hack”, operations like multiplication and division will be implemented in software later.\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/notes/202208041235-nand2tetris-note-03-the-hack-alu/","title":"NAND2Tetris Note 03 - The Hack ALU"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/notes/202208041236-nand2tetris-note-04-sequential-logic-and-memory/":{"body":"All of the chips described in the previous course notes used what is called “combinational logic”, where the output is available instantenously and there is no time-component to their operation. Combinational chips compute functions that depend solely on combinations of their input values.\nSequential logic incorporates the concept of time, or more specifically, discretized time in the form of a clock signal into determining their output. This is the core concept behind digital circuits with memory. Just like how NAND formed the basic building blocks of combinational logic, the “D-Flip-Flip” is the fundamental building block used to build sequential logic. A D-Flip-Flop can be built out of nand-gates using a loop-based design but that is beyond the scope of the course.\nClocked Data Flip Flop (D Flip-Flop or DFF)\nThe D Flip-Flop has one input “in” and one output “out”. There’s also an implicit “clock” signal that cycles from high to low and back to high to make a single “clock cycle”. The output of the D flip-flip is simply the input of the last time step (with the output of the initial timestep being indeterminate).\nD-Flip-Flops are combined in various ways with combinational logic circuits to build up basic memory units like a 1-bit register, larger addressed registers (RAM) and counters that form the basis of computer memory.\nOne-Bit Register\nA bit regsiter has two inputs “in” and “load” and a single output “out”. The output is the same as the last output if “load” is zero. It is equal to “in” if “load” is set to one. The HDL imlementation uses a Mux to select between the lastOutput and the current input. This is then passed into a DFF and the output of the DFF is the output of the register.\nMux(a=lastOutput, b=in, sel=load, out=dffIn);\nDFF(in=dffIn, out=out, out=lastOutput);\n\nThe output of the DFF is fanned out to the input of the Mux as well. This is possible because HDL is not a programming language. It can be thought of as a description of electrical wiring. So the output line of the DFF is looped back to the input of the Mux here.\n16-bit register\nA 16-bit register chip has a 16-bit input in, a single bit load input and a 16-bit output, out. This can be implemented by stacking 8 one-bit register and fanning out the load input to all of them. The inputs and outputs of each “bit” chip is wired to the individual bits of in and out respectively.\nRAM8 chip\nThis is a chip that can store 8 “words” (in this case 16-bit words). The chip has a 16-bit in input, 3-bit address  input and a 16-bit output, out. It uses a Demuxer to split out the address into 8 different load bits which are then fed into Register chips. in is fanned out to all the underlying Register chips. The outputs of the registers are then connected to the out pin through a Multiplexer with the address as its selector. \nRAM64, RAM512, RAM4K and RAM16K\nThese are built in the same manner as RAM8 but by composing RAMx chips using a Demuxer and Muxer. RAM64 has a 6-bit address input, where the 3 most-significant bits select the underlying RAM8 chip and the 3 LSBs signify the address in the underlying RAM8. Therefore the load bit is wired to the RAM8 chips through a Demuxer with address[3..5] as the sel input and address[0..2] is passed through directly to the underlying chips. The output is similarly muxed using address[3..5] as the selector. The higher capacity chips are built in the same way by stacking 4 or 8 lower capacity chips and an appropriately sized Demuxer and Muxer.\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/notes/202208041236-nand2tetris-note-04-sequential-logic-and-memory/","title":"NAND2Tetris Note 04 - Sequential Logic and Memory"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/notes/202208042109-nand2tetris-note-05-hack-assembly-language/":{"body":"The “Hack” computer built during this course has its own instruction set consisting of two instructions: the A-command and the C-command.\nRegisters\nA -&gt; address.

I love the flexibility, the clean and readable syntax and its huge ecosystem of libraries. However, when it comes to making modern GUIs, it comes up sort in many ways.\nThere are libraries like PyQT and Kivy to create GUIs for your Python application. However, each of them come with their own problems. Many modern UI solutions like Electron and React-Native looks to the web to avoid the problems of dealing with multiple platforms. After all, the web is one platform that DOES have it’s share of great (and at times awful) UIs.\nflybywire is my ongoing experiment to develop a declarative UI library, based off some great work by Cristian Medina. So, what is flybywire all about? Well, you need a bit of background before I can go into that.\nReact, ES6 and the Endless&nbsp;Abyss\nReact caught my interest sometime late last year when I was trying to build a desktop frontend for a Python project using Electron. I was coming back to web development after a gap of nearly six years and my last experience in the field was with jQuery and PHP.\nAfter finishing a basic tutorial, I was really excited about the possibilities of React. However, that excitement was a little dulled once I discovered the wonderful world of node-based tools that seemed almost mandatory if you wanted to create anything serious. I found that javascript is no longer the innocent, interpreted language I knew it as. ES6, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, transpilers, webpack, the endless abyss that is node-packages&nbsp;… it is easy to get lost just trying to get a hang of all these tools and frameworks.\nSo where am I going with all this? Well, my (mis?)adventures with React, Redux etc. can be summarized as:\n\nReact seems to have zeroed in on a really good way of defining UIs without much clutter. I especially loved the concept of one-way binding and views defined as pure functions of state which redraws the whole page when updated.\nI found redux to be a great addition to the React ecosystem that provides clean and predictable state management along with some very fancy debugging features.\nA Python programmer who wants to use React or Electron still has to navigate through the very confusing tooling (npm, webpack, babel etc.) before they can even start to create anything useful.\nI don’t want to deal with Javascript to design my UI.\n\nThere has to be a way to do all this in Python!\nThe Magic of Websockets\nLast week, I came across this article which seemed to reflect many of the problems that I had faced when it came to Python GUIs. The article is part of a 3-part (so far) series that ends with the creation of Sofi (Cheers Cristian!). As described in the article, Sofi is:\n\na system that will generate the necessary HTML and JavaScript code typically needed to produce a single-page application and serve it up through WebSockets\n\nThough it is at a very early stage in its design, Sofi seems to do what it is supposed to. It allows you to design UIs in Python while leveraging web technologies like Bootstrap to render them. One thing I did not like about Sofi was the imperative nature of the UI design which reminded me of jQuery (and maybe a bit of Java AWT). After my experience with React, I wanted something declarative and functional.\nSo, is it possible to leverage websockets to implement something that keeps the general idea behind Sofi, but is declarative and functional like React?\nflybywire\nflybywire is my ongoing experiment based on Sofi to create a more declarative UI library. It re-renders the page every time the state changes. It uses a virtual-dom system similar to that used by React, to only update those parts of the page that have actually changed. The coding style in flybywire applications was modeled after that of React. The library includes a helper function that allows components to be defined in a syntax inspired by JSX.\nUsage\nBelow is a really simple demo app that is included with the library:\nA simple counter app made using flybywire\nAnd this is counter.py.\nfrom flybywire.core import App  \nfrom flybywire.dom import h\n\ndef CounterView(count):  \n    \"\"\"A simple functional stateless component.\"\"\"  \n    return h('h1', str(count))\n\nclass CounterApp(App):  \n    def \\_\\_init\\_\\_(self):  \n        \"\"\"Initialize the application.\"\"\"  \n        super().\\_\\_init\\_\\_()  \n        self.set\\_initial\\_state(0)\n\ndef render(self):  \n        \"\"\"Renders view given application state.\"\"\"  \n        return h('div',  \n                    \\[CounterView(count=self.state),  \n                     h('button', '+', onclick = self.increment),  \n                     h('button', '-', onclick = self.decrement)\\]  \n                )\n\ndef increment(self, e):  \n        \"\"\"Increments counter.\"\"\"  \n        self.set\\_state(self.state + 1)\n\ndef decrement(self, e):  \n        \"\"\"Decrements counter.\"\"\"  \n        self.set\\_state(self.state - 1)\n\napp = CounterApp()  \napp.start()\n\nHow it&nbsp;Works\nThe structure of the code above should be very familiar to anyone who has worked with React before. flybywire provides a helper function for building DOM structures. It is also possible to compose the UI out of stateless, functional components (like CounterView in the above example). This DOM structure is then converted into JSON format and sent to the browser over websockets using the autobahn library. The javascript part of the library parses the virtual-DOM structure out of the JSON data and patches the existing DOM wherever it has changed. Any DOM event callbacks are also setup to be passed back to the Python app over websockets.\nSome of the core parts of this library such as the event server and event processor were directly taken from Sofi with a few modifications. Instead of Bootstrap-based widgets, flybywire allows you to define your own components that can be composed to form whatever widget you need.\nIt is now possible to make some really simple apps using flybywire. However, the library is at a very early stage, given that the First Commit in the repository was only three days ago!\nWhat doesn’t&nbsp;work\nHere’s some things that are missing and/or acts weird:\n\nSome basic manipulations of the DOM elements such as focusing a particular input box or clearing the input box after a certain action is completed are currently not possible. This will probably require putting back some of the command system from Sofi that I had removed when making flybywire. This can also possibly be fixed by moving to a platform like Electron which may give greater control over the rendering process.\nThe server shuts down as soon as you close the browser window. This is done on purpose as there is currently no way to reset the application state without restarting the server. The shared state also results in weird behavior if you open multiple windows. Once we move to a platform like Electron, flybywire will have hopefully have more fine control over the life cycle of the application.\n\nComing Soon\nI will probably add a few more features over the weekend, particularly a better Component class for creating stateful components. Any suggestions/comments/ideas and constructive criticism are welcome!\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/posts/2016/tantony-flybywire-declarative-guis-for-python-inspired-by-react-ad2131d4cbc1/","title":"flybywire — Declarative GUIs for Python inspired by React"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/posts/2016/tantony-training-a-neural-network-in-real-time-to-control-a-self-driving-car-9ee5654978b7/":{"body":"I was lucky enough to be accepted into the first cohort of Udacity’s Self Driving Car NanoDegree program back in October. Though I have been thinking of blogging about my experience since the start, it didn’t really happen till now. I am currently wrapping up Project #3 — “Behavioral Cloning”. This one was considerably tougher than the first two. However, it has been very fulfilling to finally complete it and here I will describe the approach I used for training a neural network to drive a car (in a simulator).\n\nThe project description makes it looks easy (relatively). In the first project, we detected lanes using some basic Computer Vision methods and in the second, we classified traffic signs from the German Traffic Signs dataset. The third one seemed like an extension of the second, where instead of classifying traffic signs, we had to predict steering angles based on a camera feed, using a neural network.\nCollecting Training&nbsp;Data\nUnlike Project#2, this time we had to collect our own training data. This was more challenging than expected. As it turned out, controlling Udacity’s SDC simulator with a keyboard is not a simple task. Feedback from other students on Slack seemed to indicate that it also gave bad, jittery steering angle data. Fortunately, I have a friend who is crazy about car racing games and owns a Logitech G27 Racing wheel.\n\nUdacity’s SDC Simulator\nFor training data, I recorded data (“camera” images + steering angle and other telemetry) where I drove through the two tracks a couple of times. I also recorded data while recovering from deliberate perturbations to the sides of the lane to make sure the neural net also learned how to recover from such situations.\nPicking the Architecture and Training the&nbsp;NN\nI spent a lot of time experimenting with different convolutional neural network architectures, with varying levels of success. I also tried taking existing trained models like VGG16 and Google’s Inception v3 and adapting them to this purpose. Eventually, I settled upon NVIDIA’s End-to-End Deep Learning architecture described in this paper. It was relatively small in size and hence added very little latency when running it. I proceeded to use my gaming desktop with GTX 1070 GPU to train the model on ~32000 images.\nWhat I learned is that “mean square error” was not at all a predictor of the performance of the network in the actual simulator. Another big issue was the turnaround time between collecting data, training the network and then testing it. Also, the ‘remote driving’ script provided by Udacity set the car’s throttle to a constant value with no way to control the speed.\nThat is when I came across John Chen’s post on our Slack channel about how he developed an “Agile Trainer” to reduce the turnaround time between data-collection and testing. His program uses PyGame and Joystick input to manually takeover control from the neural network whenever it deviated too much and also allowed to train the network at the same time.\nI wrote my own live trainer based on this idea, which instead used keyboard input. It turned out that my keyboard based “remote driver” was able to control the simulator more reliably than the simulator’s “Training mode”.\nBest of all, it allowed me to fine-tune the model from my bed with my Macbook Pro by “NoMachine”-ing into my desktop (which would be difficult with a joystick/racing wheel).\nHow it&nbsp;works\nThe live trainer has a Tkinter-based UI and a few simple keyboard controls.\n\nSDC Live Trainer interface\nUp/Down: Control cruise speed\nLeft/Right: Steering\nx: Toggle between autonomous and manual override modes\nc: Center steering (only in manual override mode)\nz: Toggle real-time training (only in manual override mode)\nThe speed of the car is controlled by a proportional-gain controller. It modulates the throttle based on speed feedback. This rudimentary “cruise control” gets the speed within +/- 1 mph of the target speed, which is good enough in this case.\nThe arrow keys increase/decrease the steering angle. The steering also has some slow auto re-centering dynamics added by the trainer. So the steering angle will keep “decaying” towards zero if you don’t press any key. The “autonomous rating” measures what percentage of the current session was spent in fully autonomous mode.\nReal-time training\nThe process of training itself is pretty simple. You can do one of two things:\n\nDeliberately perturb the car’s motion while in manual override and engage training mode once you have started the recovery process\nAt any spots that the model has trouble with, engage training mode while driving through the spot manually to fine-tune the model.\n\nThe GIF below shows an example of the first case. I purposely drive the car towards the right edge using manual override and then start training the model once I have it recovering and returning to the center of the lane.\nEvaluating model performance\nMy initial model had some trouble navigating a couple of turns on track#1 in the simulator. I was able to successfully tune these spots using live training and finally get this result:\nTrack 2 was a little more difficult, with more sharp gradients and curves. However, I found that decreasing the speed down to 20 mph helped it navigate that track as well!\nThe live trainer code is on Github at: thomasantony/sdc-live-trainer\nPossibilities\nA live trainer can also probably be used to perform the initial training of the network, though that would involve a lot more baby-sitting during the training process. The good thing is that you can immediately start seeing results as the model converges toward the right weights.\nIs such an architecture extendable to real-world SDCs? It can definitely be done with scale models on scale tracks. On real cars it is probably a little more difficult (though there are probably ways to do it). NVIDIA’s paper mentions using real-world data to make a simulator. A live training methodology like the one described here can possibly be incorporated into such a simulator as well!\nLet me know if you have any comments/suggestions!\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/posts/2016/tantony-training-a-neural-network-in-real-time-to-control-a-self-driving-car-9ee5654978b7/","title":"Training a neural network in real-time to control a self-driving car"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/posts/2018/":{"body":"","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/posts/2018/","title":""},"https://www.thomasantony.com/posts/2018/tantony-using-virtualcan-inside-docker-on-macos-cfa10f7e75d6/":{"body":"At SmartAg, we use Docker to manage the development and runtime environments for our embedded software.

Your docker-machine VM is now ready. It should already be running. If you restart your machine, you can start the VM by typing docker-machine start default or stop it with docker-machine stop default&nbsp;.\n9. Set the environment parameters to use docker with your new VM by running eval $(docker-machine env default)&nbsp;. This command has to be run every time you are in a new terminal.

Check that it all works:\ndocker run -it --rm --privileged alpine /bin/sh\n\nInside the docker container, run:\nzcat /proc/config.gz | grep CAN\n\nThe command should display the CAN flags that you set while compiling the kernel. SocketCAN/VirtualCAN is now enabled in any docker container that you start on this VM.\nCaveats\nRunning docker using docker-machine means that some things, such as port-forwarding does not work as you expect.

If you are running a vanilla Orbiter installation, set this to C:\\Orbiter\\Orbiter.exe instead.\n\nI got this handy tip from Andrew Stokes’ video. Go to C++ &gt; Code Generation in the Property Sheet. Change Runtime Library to “Multithreaded (/MT)” for your “Release” configuration and “Multithreaded Debug (/MTd)” for your “Debug” configuration. This removes an external dependency on Visual Studio Runtime DLL.\n\n\nAt this point, if you hit Build (F7), you may get an error saying:\nRC : fatal error RC1110: could not open CustomMFD.rc\n\nIf this happens, switch back to “Solution Explorer” and delete the CustomMFD.rc file. Now the project should build successfully. It should be noted that the compiler places the output in the C:\\Orbiter\\Modules\\Plugin directory by default. This can be verified by deleting C:\\Orbiter\\Modules\\Plugin\\CustomMFD.dll and rebuilding the project. Ensure that CustomMFD.dll appears in the folder after you build the project. You can now run Orbiter as usual or have Visual Studio start it for you by hitting “Debug”. Activate the Module within Orbiter Launcher as shown below to test it in the simulator.\n\nYour development environment is now ready.\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/posts/2020/orbiter-sdk-vs-2019/","title":"Setting up the Orbiter 2016 SDK in Visual Studio 2019"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/posts/2021/":{"body":"","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/posts/2021/","title":""},"https://www.thomasantony.com/posts/2021/msl-apollo-guidance/":{"body":"\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nThis post is a companion to the video linked above and includes a full derivation of the Apollo entry guidance longitudinal control algorithm. Please watch the video for more context. Full source code of Jupyter notebooks implementing the algorithm can be found at thomasantony/msl-apollo-entry-guidance.\nNASA’s Mars Science Laboratory mission showcased an advancement in entry technology that allowed it to land much closer to its designated landing site than previous missions. It used with great success, the same guidance algorithm originally used by the Apollo Command Module when returning from the moon. By modulating its lift vector, MSL was able to counteract errors in its trajectory during hypersonic flight and combined with the famous “sky-crane” maneuver, deliver the Curiosity rover to within 2.5 km of its targeted landing site next to Gale Crater. Last year’s Mars 2020 mission used the same guidance system to successfully land the Perseverance rover within Jezero crater.\nApollo Guidance Algorithm Overview\nThe goal of the Apollo guidance algorithm is to minimize the error in “range” along the ground when compared to that of a pre-computed reference trajectory. It does not try to exactly match the reference trajectory, but instead computes a constant bank angle that is supposed to minimize the downrange distance error at the point where the vehicle reaches terminal altitude. This computation is repeated several times a second in the same manner as a closed-loop control system to correct for deviations in the trajectory due to external or internal factors.\nThe guidance algorithm uses bank angle to control the amount of vertical lift. This has the side-effect of causing lateral motion that takes the spacecraft away from the desired path. In order to account for this, the bank angle commanded is reversed when the predicted cross-range error exceeds a certain amount, effectively creating a series of S-turns. This is similar to the S-turns performed by the Space Shuttle during its re-entry.\nThis article focuses on the downrange error control.\n2DOF Dynamic Model\nThe MSL entry vehicle is modeled in two-dimensions using a vehicle-centric polar coordinate system. The state variables in the model are altidude ($h$), downrange distance ($s$), speed ($v$) and flight path angle($\\gamma$). Their equations of motion are as follows:\n\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\frac{d h}{dt} &amp;= v \\sin{\\gamma} \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\frac{d s}{dt} &amp;= v \\cos{\\gamma}  \\\\\n    \\frac{d v}{dt} &amp;= -{{D/m}} - {{g}} \\sin(\\gamma)  \\\\\n    \\frac{d \\gamma}{dt} &amp;= \\frac{1}{v} \\left(\\frac{v^2 \\cos(\\gamma)}{{{R_M}} + h} + \\frac{L \\cos{u}}{m} - {{g}}\\cos(\\gamma)\\right) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere \n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{D}{m} &amp;= \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2 \\beta} &amp;;&amp; \\text{ Drag Acceleration}\\\\\n\\frac{L}{m} &amp;= \\frac{D}{m}\\enspace (L/D) &amp;;&amp;\\text{ Lift Acceleration}\\\\\n\\nonumber\\\\\n\\rho &amp;= \\rho_0 e^{-h/H} &amp;;&amp; \\text{ Atmosphere Model}\\\\\n\\nonumber\\\\\n\\beta &amp;= 120 \\text{kg/m$^2$} &amp;;&amp; \\text{ Ballistic Coefficient} \\\\\n(L/D) &amp;= 0.24 &amp;;&amp;\\text{ Lift-to-Drag Ratio}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSurface atmospheric density, $\\rho_0$ and scale height, $H$ define the exponential atmospheric model. $g$ is a constant value for acceleration due to gravity. $u$ is the bank angle of the vehicle. The states are collectively referred to as $\\mathbf{x}$. The equations of motions may be collectively referred to as $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}, u, t)$.\nDeriving the Apollo Entry Guidance Algorithm\nNote on the Variation Operator\nThis derivation requires the use of the “variation operator”, denoted by $\\delta$, sometimes called a functional derivative or variational derivative. A functional is a function that acts on functions. For example, $J(y(t))$ is a functional because $y$ is itself a function of time. Here $J$ is a scalar quantity derived from a function $y(t)$, that essentially consists of an infinite number of points. \nThe variational operator is to functionals, what derivatives are to functions. Similar to how a stationary point of a function can be found by setting its derivative to zero, the stationary point of a functional can be found by setting its variation to zero. \nPlease check the following links if you want to learn more:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqDHO2eKXcs\nhttps://canvas.vt.edu/files/1315932/download?download_frd=1\nDeriving bank angle policy\n\nThe goal is to find the constant bank angle $u$ that will guide the spacecraft from the perturbed starting state $\\mathbf{x_0}$ to the same range as the reference trajectory. Let’s call this function $J$. Any variable with an “f” in the suffix denotes that it is evaluated at the terminal point of the trajectory and the ‘*’ denotes that it is part of the reference trajectory.\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\nJ = R_f &amp;= s_f + \\dot{s_f} dt_f = s_f + v_f \\cos(\\gamma_f)  dt_f \\label{eqn:J_1}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nFrom the equations of motion,\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\dot{h_f} &amp;= \\frac{dh_f}{dt_f} \\implies dt_f = \\frac{dh_f}{\\dot{h_f}} \\label{eqn:h_f_expr}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nSubstituting $\\eqref{eqn:h_f_expr}$ in $\\eqref{eqn:J_1}$,\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\nJ &amp;= s_f + \\frac{v_f \\cos(\\gamma_f) }{\\dot{h_f}} dh_f \\\\ \n &amp;= s_f + \\frac{v_f \\cos(\\gamma_f)}{v_f \\sin(\\gamma_f)} dh_f\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nAssuming that the reference trajectory terminates at the ground, we get $dh_f = 0 - h_f = -h_f$\n\n    $$\n\\implies J = s_f - cot(\\gamma_f) h_f = \\Phi(\\mathbf{x}_f)\n$$\n\nWe want to now find a constant value of $u$ that will keep J constant at $J = R_f = R_f^*$ even with perturbations. We are able to control the trajectory by influencing $u$ and are constrained by physics i.e. equations of motion, $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x},u,t)$. These constraints can be adjoined to $J$ using co-states $\\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal = \\left[\\lambda_h\\enspace\\lambda_s\\enspace\\lambda_v\\enspace\\lambda_\\gamma\\right]$, one for each state. This is very similar to Lagrange multipliers used in function optimization. In this case, each costate is a function that has its own equation of motion which will be derived here.\n\n    $$\nJ' =  \\Phi(\\mathbf{x}_f) + \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal(t) \\left\\{ \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x},u, t) - \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\right\\} dt\n$$\n\nTo find the stationary point of $J$ we apply the variation operator. We also shorten $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x},u, t)$ to just $\\mathbf{f}$.\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\delta J' &amp;= \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}\\delta \\mathbf{x}\\bigg|_{t=t_f}  + \\delta \\left[ \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal(t) \\left\\{ \\mathbf{f} - \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}) \\right\\} dt \\right] \\nonumber\\\\\n&amp;= \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}\\delta \\mathbf{x}\\bigg|_{t=t_f}  + \\delta \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\bigg[ \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal(t) \\mathbf{f} - \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal(t)\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\bigg] dt \\nonumber\\\\\n&amp;= \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}\\delta \\mathbf{x}\\bigg|_{t=t_f}  + \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\delta \\big[ \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal(t) \\mathbf{f} \\big] - \\delta\\big[\\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal(t)\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\big] dt  \\nonumber\\\\\n&amp;= \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}\\delta \\mathbf{x}\\bigg|_{t=t_f}  + \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\delta \\big[ \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal(t) \\mathbf{f} \\big] - \\delta\\big[\\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\big] dt \n\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nApplying the chain rule to the variation operator\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\delta J' &amp;= \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}\\delta \\mathbf{x}\\bigg|_{t=t_f}  + \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal \\delta \\mathbf{f} + \\delta\\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal \\mathbf{f} - \\delta\\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal(t)\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} - \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal\\delta\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} \\enspace\\enspace dt  \\label{eqn:Jprime_1}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nApplying Leibniz Rule to the first term of the integral in ${\\eqref{eqn:Jprime_1}}$,\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal \\delta \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}, u, t)\\enspace dt = \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\mathbf{\\lambda^\\intercal} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} \\delta\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{\\lambda^\\intercal} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{u}} \\delta\\mathbf{u}\\enspace dt \\label{eqn:Jprime_int_term1}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nIntegrating by parts, the fourth term of the integral in ${\\eqref{eqn:Jprime_1}}$,\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal(t)\\enspace\\delta\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\enspace dt &amp;= \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\frac{d}{dt}\\big( \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal \\delta \\mathbf{x} \\big) dt - \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\dot{\\mathbf{\\lambda}}(t)\\enspace\\delta x \\enspace dt \\\\\n&amp;= \\bigg[ {\\lambda}^\\intercal \\delta \\mathbf{x} \\bigg]_{t_0}^{t_f} - \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\dot{\\mathbf{\\lambda}}(t)\\enspace\\delta x \\enspace dt \\label{eqn:Jprime_int_term4}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nSubstituting $\\eqref{eqn:Jprime_int_term1}$ and $\\eqref{eqn:Jprime_int_term4}$ in ${\\eqref{eqn:Jprime_1}}$,\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\delta J' &amp;= \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}\\delta \\mathbf{x}\\bigg|_{t=t_f}  + \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\mathbf{\\lambda^\\intercal} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} \\delta\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{\\lambda^\\intercal} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{u}} \\delta\\mathbf{u}  + \\delta\\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal \\overbrace{\\left(\\mathbf{f} - \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\right)}^{= 0} \\enspace dt - \\bigg[ {\\lambda}^\\intercal \\delta \\mathbf{x} \\bigg]_{t_0}^{t_f} + \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\dot{\\mathbf{\\lambda}}(t)\\enspace\\delta x \\enspace dt \\\\\n\n\\delta J' &amp;= \\bigg[\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} - \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal\\bigg)\\delta \\mathbf{x}\\bigg]_{t=t_f}  + \\left( \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal \\delta \\mathbf{x} \\right)\\bigg|_{t=t_0}+ \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\delta\\mathbf{x}(\\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}  + \\dot{\\mathbf{\\lambda}}) \\enspace dt + \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{u}} \\delta\\mathbf{u} \\enspace dt\\label{eqn:Jprime_2}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nSet $\\delta J’ = 0$ to find the stationary point of $J’$.

However this can be very expensive (especially considering the hardware this was originally designed for). So we differentiate (34) w.r.t $t_0$ and apply Leibniz Rule to get\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial \\lambda_u}{\\partial t_0} &amp;= -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}^\\intercal \\mathbf{\\lambda}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThe boundary condition for $\\lambda_u$ can be obtained as :\n\n    $$\n\\lambda_u(t_0=t_f) = \\int_{t_f}^{t_f}-\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}^\\intercal \\mathbf{\\lambda}\\enspace dt = 0\n$$\n\nApollo Guidance Bank Angle Policy\nWhen we actually implement this guidance algorithm, $t_0$ and $\\mathbf{\\mathbf{x}_0}$ corresponds to the “current” time and state of the spacecraft. All the $\\delta{\\mathbf{x}}$ values are therefore computed by comparing the current trajectory to the reference trajectory. For example, \n$\\delta h(v_0) = h(v_0) - h^{*}(v_0)$ \nwhere $h(v_0)$ is the current altitude and $h^*(v_0)$ is the altitude on the reference trajectory corresponding to the current speed. \nPutting it all together, $\\eqref{eqn:delu_1}$ becomes\n\n    $$\n\\delta u =  -\\frac{\\frac{-H\\lambda_h^*(v_0)}{(D/m)^*(v_0)}\\delta((D/m) (v_0)) + \\lambda_s^*(v_0) \\delta s(v_0) +  \\frac{\\lambda_\\gamma^*(v_0)}{v_0^* \\cos{(\\gamma(v_0))}}\\delta\\dot{h}(v_0)}{\\lambda_u^*(v_0)}\n$$\n\nThe terms containing $*$ can be pre-computed on the ground along with teh reference trajectory. These terms can therefore be substituted by:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\nF_1(v_0) &amp;= \\frac{H \\lambda_h^*(v_0)}{\\frac{D}{m}^*(v_0)}\\\\\nF_2(v_0) &amp;= \\frac{\\lambda_\\gamma^*(v_0)}{v_0^* \\cos{\\gamma^*(v_0)}} \\\\\nF_3(v_0) &amp;= \\lambda_u^*(v_0)\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nAlso, it can be found that $\\lambda_s$ has a constant value of 1 since $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{s}}{\\partial s} = 0$ and $\\lambda_s(t_f) = 1$. \nSo the final expression for $\\delta u$ becomes:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\delta u =  \\frac{- \\delta s(v_0) -F_1(v_0) \\delta(\\frac{D}{m} (v_0))  - F_2 (v_0) \\delta\\dot{h}(v_0)}{F_3(v_0)}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n$\\delta u$ is added to the reference bank angle $u$ to obtain the bank angle to be commanded in each guidance cycle.\nSome Notes on Implementation\nOne key bottleneck that I found during implementation was the data-lookup within the reference trajectory data. Right now, the reference trajectory data is stored in a 2D numpy array. In every guidance cycle, we do a lookup within this array to find the data row with the closest value of velocity to the vehicle’s current velocity. This could be made much more efficient with a better data structure.\nConclusion\nThe Jupyter notebooks implement the algorithm as well as a Monte Carlo simulation system for testing it. I will be updating them to add more notes and details on the implementation to clarify things further.\nReferences\n[1] R.D.Braun and R.M.

You can see the transcripts of some of my conversations with it here. Today I tried to get it to generate audio, specifically music. \nTLDR: It can generate some notes. But maybe it can do more with careful prompting.\nAnyway, my musical background extends as far as trying to teach myself to play the piano and the violin using Youtube tutorials and I didn’t really get too far. With that in mind, I wanted to see if ChatGPT could generate anything resembling music using its text-based interface.\nIn my first conversation, I asked it for a suitable format and it informed me about the existence of MusicXML. I also had it write a parser/player for it in Python. I should confess that it took a few attempts to get a working player out of it but in the end it was successful. I discovered the library music21 with my initial prompts and then found that pygame can playback MIDI files. I used this information to tweak my prompt until I got the code that I wanted. \nHere is the final code it generated for playing MusicXML files:\nimport sys\nimport music21\nimport pygame\nfrom pygame.locals import *\n\n# Get the MusicXML file from the command line argument\nif len(sys.argv) != 2:\n    print('Please provide a MusicXML file as a command line argument')\n    sys.exit(1)\n\nmusic_xml_file = sys.argv[1]\n\n# Convert the MusicXML file to a MIDI file using music21\nmidi_file = music21.converter.parse(music_xml_file).write('midi')\n\n# Initialize pygame\npygame.init()\npygame.mixer.init()\n\n# Load the MIDI file and play it\npygame.mixer.music.load(midi_file)\npygame.mixer.music.play()\n\n# Wait for the playback to finish before exiting\nclock = pygame.time.Clock()\nwhile pygame.mixer.music.get_busy():\n    clock.tick(30)\n\nArmed with the file, I then asked it to generate a sample MusicXML file and it actually made something that could be played back! So then I went further and wanted to see if it could generate specific tunes.

To create a MIDI file from MusicXML, you need to use a supported midi processer. Do you want me to support midi processing in the future?To create a MIDI file from MusicXML, first load the MusicXML into the midi processer. Then use the processer's functionality to convert the MusicXML into a MIDI file. The MIDI file can then be used in multiple midi applications. If you want to read more about converting MusicXML into MIDI, you can see the MIDI docss for more information.To specify the C-major scale in MusicXML, you can use the following code:\\n&lt;code&gt;\\n&lt;scope-partwise version=\"3.1\"&gt;\\n &lt;part-list&gt;\\n &lt;score-part id=\"P2\"&gt;\\n &lt;part-name&gt;Paino Part&lt;/part-name&gt;\\n &lt;/score-part&gt;\\n &lt;/part-list&gt;\\n &lt;part id=\"P2\"&gt;\\n &lt;measure number=\"1\"&gt;\\n &lt;attributes&gt;\\n &lt;divisions&gt;1&lt;/divisions&gt;\\n &lt;key&gt;\\n &lt;fifthhs&gt;0&lt;/fifthhs&gt;\\n &lt;/key&gt;\\n &lt;time&gt;\\n &lt;beats&gt;3&lt;/beats&gt;\\n &lt;beat-type&gt;3&lt;/beat-type&gt;\\n &lt;/time&gt;\\n &lt;clef&gt;\\n &lt;sign&gt;G&lt;/sign&gt;\\n &lt;line&gt;2&lt;/line&gt;\\n &lt;/clef&gt;\\n &lt;/attributes&gt;\\n &lt;note&gt;\\n &lt;p&gt;\\n &lt;step&gt;C&lt;/step&gt;\\n &lt;octave&gt;4&lt;/octave&gt;\\n &lt;/p&gt;\\n &lt;duration&gt;1&lt;/duration&gt;\\n &lt;type&gt;quarter&lt;/type&gt;\\n &lt;/note&gt;\\n &lt;note&gt;\\n &lt;p&gt;\\n &lt;step&gt;D-alter&lt;/step&gt;\\n &lt;octave&gt;4&lt;/octave&gt;\\n &lt;/p&gt;\\n &lt;duration&gt;1&lt;/duration&gt;\\n &lt;type&gt;quarter&lt;/type&gt;\\n &lt;/note&gt;\\n &lt;note&gt;\\n &lt;p&gt;\\n &lt;step&gt;E&lt;/step&gt;\\n &lt;octave&gt;4&lt;/octave&gt;\\n &lt;/p&gt;\\n &lt;duration&gt;1&lt;/duration&gt;\\n &lt;type&gt;quarter&lt;/type&gt;\\n &lt;/note&gt;\\n &lt;note&gt;\\n &lt;p&gt;\\n &lt;step&gt;F&amp;amp;&lt;/step&gt;\\n &lt;octave&gt;4&lt;/octave&gt;\\n &lt;/p&gt;\\n &lt;duration&gt;1&lt;/duration&gt;\\n &lt;type&gt;quarter&lt;/type&gt;\\n &lt;/note&gt;\\n &lt;note&gt;\\n &lt;p&gt;\\n &lt;step&gt;F&amp;amp;+1&lt;/step&gt;\\n &lt;octave&gt;4&lt;/octave&gt;\\n &lt;/p&gt;\\n &lt;duration&gt;1&lt;/duration&gt;\\n &lt;type&gt;quarter&lt;/type&gt;\\n &lt;/note&gt;\\n &lt;note&gt;\\n &lt;p&gt;\\n &lt;step&gt;G&lt;/step&gt;\\n &lt;octave&gt;4&lt;/octave&gt;\\n &lt;/p&gt;\n\nThis was followed by some binary data that trashed the blog post formatting so I have removed it here. \nThis is quite strange.

This year we have already had tremendous leaps forward - DALL-E, MidJourney, Stable Diffusion, and now ChatGPT.

I previously took a stab at this back in 2020 with limited success. I was much less knowledgeable about Rust at the time and the tooling around C++ bindings were not as mature then. This post is a companion to this new repository that contains a proof-of-concept for building a spacecraft addon for Orbiter in Rust.\nWhy Rust?\nRust is a relatively new high level systems programming language with a focus on safety. Orbiter is written in C++ and therefore its addons are also typically written in C++. Rust development for Orbiter is facilitated using the cxx crate.\nDesign\nThe repository in its current form produces a DLL file as its build artifact that can be loaded into Orbiter as an addon module. Anyone wanting to create a Rust addon will clone/fork the repository and build it along with the the Rust code for their addon.(See update below). \nThere are a limited number of Orbiter SDK functions currently available as Rust bindings in this prototype.\nThis will expand in the future to hopefully encompass the majority of the API. The repository includes a demo addon that models NASA’s Surveyor probe. This follows from the C++ tutorial at OrbiterWiki and implements retro-thruster staging and differential thrust attitude control.\nDeveloping custom spacecraft addons\nUpdate 01/11/2022: This section has been changed to reflect changes to the crate\nAll the spacecraft-specific code in the repository lives in its own file (src/shuttle_pb.rs for example).\nAn addon crate implementing a spacecraft should import the orbiter_rs crate. It should then set its crate-type to cdylib. \n[package]\nname = \"shuttlepb\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"Thomas Antony\"]\nedition = \"2018\"\n\n[lib]\ncrate-type = [\"cdylib\"]\n\n[dependencies]\norbiter_rs = { version = \"0.1\", path = \"/path/to/orbiter-rs\" }\n\nThe crate should then have a lib.rs containing a struct that implements the OrbiterVessel trait. It should then use the init_vessel macro as shown below. This macro generates a stub that is links the Rust code to the OrbiterSDK. For example, in lib.rs:\nuse orbiter_rs::{\n    ODebug, OrbiterVessel, VesselContext, _V, init_vessel, FileHandle\n};\n\n#[derive(Default, Debug)]\npub struct ShuttlePB {\n    _some_param: i32\n}\n\nimpl OrbiterVessel for ShuttlePB {\n    fn set_class_caps(&amp;mut self, context: &amp;VesselContext, _cfg: FileHandle) {\n        context.SetSize(1.0);\n        context.SetPMI(_V!(0.50, 0.50, 0.50));\n        context.AddMesh(\"ShuttlePB\".to_string());\n    }\n}\n\ninit_vessel!(\n    fn init(_h_vessel: OBJHANDLE, _flight_model: i32) -&gt; ShuttlePB\n    {\n        ShuttlePB::default()\n    }\n    fn exit() {}\n);\n\nThe addon may use any of the wrapped functions currently available. Any other Orbiter SDK functions will require wrappers to be generated for them. An automated tool like autocxx may be worth investigating for this purpose.\nBuilding and Installing\nThe addon can be built using cargo build assuming that Visual Studio 2019 is available. Other C++ compilers may or may not work. Deploying the addon also requires a config file and any meshes and other dependencies. An example can be seen in Config/Surveyor.cfg. Once you build the addon, the DLL will be available in the target/i686-pc-windows-msvc/debug folder. This will need to be renamed to match whatever module name you haev in the configuration file.\nSummary\nThis proof-of-concept gives a basic framework for building Orbiter addons in Rust. It is not a complete system by any metric and will require significant amounts of work before it can be considered that.\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/posts/orbiter-addon-rust/","title":"Orbiter Addon Development in Rust"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/":{"body":"","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/","title":"Projects"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/classical-mechanics/":{"body":"Go to Workbook\nI am currently studying classical mechanics using Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics (aka SICM) by Gerald Sussman and Jack Wisdom. This is part of working towards my eventual goal of properly understanding the math behind General Relativity. Once I am done with SICM, I will move on to Functional Differential Geometry (aka FDG) by the same authors. I have taken a couple of courses on Classical Mechanics and Variational Calculus while in gradschool. But this is the first book on the subject that I have found to be engaging while also explaining the concepts really well. I am hoping that the GR book will be similarly elucidating on the subject.\nThe key factor that sets apart SICM (and FDG) from other textbooks is that it uses computer programs as a way to present its ideas. Expressing the concepts in a computer language (in this case, Scheme), forces the author to be precise and unambiguous. The authors have written a library called scmutils that is required for implementing the methods presented in the book while working through it. Sam Ritchie has made a Clojure version of scmutils called sicmutils. This is what I used to create my workbooks, along with along with CloJupyter.\nWith all that said, I still find a few spots where a step is missing or it is not entirely clear how the authors came to a certain conclusion. In these cases, I think it is important to note it down, so that it can be a reference for me (and others) in the future. To this end, I will be publishing my notes and exercise solutions here. These are Jupyter notebooks converted into markdown and then to HTML.

And in order for the variation to be tangent to the constraint at a given time, it must satisfy the condition:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n(\\partial_1 \\varphi \\circ \\Gamma[q])\\eta + (\\partial_2 \\varphi \\circ \\Gamma[q])D\\eta = 0\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNow consider constraints that are only functions of the coordinates, i.e,\n\n    $$\n\\partial_2 \\varphi = 0\\\\\n$$\n\nNow the variation is tangent to the constraint if\n\n    $$\n(\\partial_1 \\varphi \\circ \\Gamma[q])\\eta = 0 \\tag{1.186}\n$$\n\nWe also know from Eq. 1.183 in the previous section that,\n\n    $$\n\\{ (\\partial_1 L \\circ \\Gamma[q]) - D\\left( \\partial_2 L \\circ \\Gamma[q] \\right) \\} \\eta = 0 \\tag{1.183}\n$$\n\nEq. 1.186 and 1.183 together should determine the motion of the constrained system.\nEq 1.183 is satisfied if the dot product of the first term (aka the residual of Lagranges Equations) and $\\eta(t)$ is zero at all times. This is also the definition for two functions of time to be orthogonal to each other. To quote footnote 92 from the book:\n\nWe take two tuple-valued functions of time to be orthogonal if at each instant the dot product of the tuples is zero. Similarly, tuple-valued functions are considered parallel if at each moment one of the tuples is a scalar multiple of the other. The scalar multiplier is in general a function of time.\n\nSo the residual of the Lagrange equations is orthogonal to any $\\eta(t)$. Also, $\\eta(t)$ is tangent to the constraint surface, which means that it is orthogonal to the normal to the constraint surface. \n\nA vector that is orthogonal to all vectors orthogonal to a given vector is parallel to the given vector.\n\nTherefore, the residual of Lagrange equations is parallel to the normal to the constraint surface; which means the two functions are proportional:\n\n    $$\n(\\partial_1 L \\circ \\Gamma[q]) - D\\left( \\partial_2 L \\circ \\Gamma[q] \\right) = \\lambda (\\partial_1 \\varphi \\circ \\Gamma[q])\\tag{1.187}\n$$\n\nThe proportionality factor $\\lambda$ is itself a function of time and need not be a constant. This equation, along with the constraint equation $\\varphi \\circ \\Gamma[q] = 0$ is enough to determine the path $q$ and to eliminate the unknown function $\\lambda$.\nWe can now form an augmented Lagrangian by treating $\\lambda$ as one of the coordinates.\n\n    $$\nL'(t; q,\\lambda;\\dot{q},\\dot{\\lambda}) = L(t,q,\\dot{q})+ \\lambda\\varphi(t,q,\\dot{q})\n$$\n\nThe Lagrange equations associated with the coordinates are just the modified Lagrangian in Eq. 1.187. The equation assoicated with $\\lambda$ is just the constraint equation. So the system is fully specified. This Lagrangian is also of the same form as the one described in Section 1.6.2.\nHow do we eliminate $\\lambda$ from the Lagrange Equations?\nIf the new function $\\lambda$, can be written as a composition of a local tuple function over the original, unaugmented path: $\\lambda = \\Lambda \\circ \\Gamma[q]$, then it is a redundant degree of freedom and can be eliminated from the system if required.\nConsider the Lagrangian with an extra term $\\Lambda\\varphi$ where $\\varphi$ is the constraint function:\n\n    $$\nL'' = L + \\Lambda\\varphi\\\\\n$$\n\nThe Lagrange equations for $L’‘$ is the same as that for $L$ but with some extra terms arising from $\\Lambda\\varphi$. Applying the Euler-Lagrange operator to $L’’$:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathscr{E}[L''] &amp;= \\mathscr{E}[L + \\Lambda\\varphi] = \\mathscr{E}[L] + \\mathscr{E}[\\Lambda\\varphi]\\\\\n &amp;=  \\mathscr{E}[L] + \\mathscr{E}[\\Lambda] \\varphi + \\Lambda\\mathscr{E}[\\varphi] + (D_t \\Lambda)\\partial_2 \\varphi + (D_t \\varphi)\\partial_2 \\Lambda\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nComposing $\\mathscr{E}[L]$ with $\\Lambda[q]$ results in the Lagrange equations for $L’’$. Since the constraints are satisfied on the path, $\\varphi \\circ \\Gamma[q] = 0$, which implies that $D_t(\\Lambda \\circ \\Gamma[q]) = 0$.\nTherefore, composing $\\mathscr{E}[L]$ with $\\Lambda[q]$, we get:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathscr{E}[L'']\\circ\\Gamma[q] &amp;= \\mathscr{E}[L]\\circ\\Gamma[q] + (\\mathscr{E}[\\Lambda]\\circ\\Gamma[q])\\underbrace{\\cancel{\\varphi}}_{=0}\n+ \\underbrace{(\\Lambda\\circ\\Gamma[q])}_{=\\lambda}(\\mathscr{E}[\\varphi]\\circ\\Gamma[q])\\\\\n&amp;\\quad+ (D_t \\Lambda)(\\partial_2 \\varphi\\circ\\Gamma[q]) + (\\underbrace{\\cancel{D_t \\varphi}}_{=0})(\\partial_2 \\Lambda\\circ\\Gamma[q]) \\\\\n&amp;= \\mathscr{E}[L]\\circ\\Gamma[q] + \\lambda(\\mathscr{E}[\\varphi]\\circ\\Gamma[q]) + (D_t \\Lambda)(\\partial_2 \\varphi\\circ\\Gamma[q])\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n$\\partial_2\\varphi = 0$ as the constraints do not depend on velocity. Then,\n\n    $$\n\\mathscr{E}[L'']\\circ\\Gamma[q] = \\mathscr{E}[L]\\circ\\Gamma[q] + \\lambda(\\mathscr{E}[\\varphi]\\circ\\Gamma[q])\\tag{1.192}\n$$\n\nWe can see here that the Lagrange equations for $L’‘$ is the same as that for $L’$, with an extra term. Comparing this to Eq. 1.187, we can see that $\\lambda = \\Lambda \\circ \\Gamma[q]$, which is determined purely by the unaugmented state. Therefore $\\lambda$ can be eliminated from the Lagrange equations of the augmented Lagrangian.\nThe explicit Lagrange equations derived from the augmented Lagrangian depend on the accelerations $D^2 q$ as well as $\\lambda$. Now that $\\lambda$ has been showed to be derived purely form the unaugmented state, so too is $D^2 q$ (as there are no other elements in the dynamic equations). Therefore the dynamic evolution of the system is determined purely by the dynamical state.\nThe Pendulum using Constraints\n$$\\require{cancel}$$\n\nFigure 1.8\nThe pendulum can be modeled as a point-mass constrained to always be at a constant distance from a pivot point. The system can be represented by the following Lagrangian and constraint:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\nL(t; x,y; v_x,v_y) &amp;= \\frac{1}{2} m (v_x^2 + v_y^2) - mgy\\\\\nx^2+y^2-l^2 &amp;= 0\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe augmented Lagrangian is:\n\n    $$\nL(t; x,y,\\lambda; v_x,v_y,\\dot{\\lambda}) = \\frac{1}{2} m (v_x^2 + v_y^2) - mgy + \\lambda(x^2+y^2-l^2)\\\\\n$$\n\nThe Lagrange equations for this augmented Lagrangian is:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\nm D^2x - 2\\lambda x = 0 \\tag{1.196}\\\\\nm D^2y + mg - 2\\lambda y = 0 \\tag{1.197}\\\\\nx^2 + y^2 - l^2 = 0\\tag{1.198}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThese equations can be simplified by switching to polar coordinates, $x = r\\sin{\\theta}$ and $y = -r\\cos{\\theta}$. Substituting this in the constraint equation, we get, $r = l$. Plugging this into the equations 1.196 and 1.197:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &amp; = m D^2 (l\\sin\\theta) - 2\\lambda l\\sin\\theta \\\\\n    &amp; = m (D(l \\cos\\theta D\\theta)) - 2\\lambda l\\sin\\theta\\\\\n0 &amp;= ml (\\cos\\theta D^2\\theta - \\sin\\theta (D\\theta)^2) - 2\\lambda l\\sin\\theta \\tag{1.200}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &amp;= m D^2 (-l\\cos\\theta) + mgl - 2\\lambda (-l\\cos\\theta) \\\\\n  &amp;= m (D(l \\sin\\theta D\\theta)) + 2\\lambda l\\cos\\theta \\\\\n0 &amp;= ml (\\sin\\theta D^2\\theta + \\cos\\theta (D\\theta)^2) + 2\\lambda l\\cos\\theta + mg \\tag{1.201}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nMultiply Eq. 1.200 by $\\cos\\theta$ and Eq. 1.201 by $\\sin{\\theta}$ and add to get:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &amp;=ml (\\cos\\theta D^2\\theta - \\sin\\theta (D\\theta)^2)\\cos\\theta - \\cancel{2\\lambda l\\sin\\theta \\cos \\theta}\\\\\n  &amp; \\quad+ ml (\\sin\\theta D^2\\theta + \\cos\\theta (D\\theta)^2)\\sin\\theta + \\cancel{2\\lambda l\\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta} + mg\\sin\\theta\\\\\n &amp;= ml (\\cos^2\\theta D^2\\theta) - \\cancel{ml \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta(D\\theta)^2} \\\\\n  &amp; \\quad+ ml (\\sin^2 \\theta D^2\\theta) + \\cancel{ml \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta(D\\theta)^2} + mg\\sin\\theta \\\\\n &amp;=ml D^2\\theta (\\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2 \\theta ) + mg\\sin\\theta \\\\\n0&amp;= ml D^2\\theta + mg\\sin\\theta \n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis is indeed the same equation as what we get if we used $\\theta$ as an unconstrained generalized coordinate for the pendulum. We can also compute $\\lambda$ in terms of the other variables from Eq.1.196 as:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lambda &amp;= \\frac{m D^2 x}{2x} = \\frac{m D^2 (l\\sin\\theta)}{2l\\sin\\theta} \\\\\n        &amp;= \\frac{m (D(l \\cos\\theta D\\theta))}{2l\\sin\\theta} \\\\\n        &amp;= \\frac{ml \\cos\\theta D^2\\theta - ml \\sin\\theta (D\\theta)^2}{2l\\sin\\theta} \\\\\n        &amp;= \\frac{\\overbrace{ml D^2\\theta}^{-mg\\sin\\theta}\\cos\\theta  - ml \\sin\\theta (D\\theta)^2}{2l\\sin\\theta} \\\\\n        &amp;= \\frac{-mg\\cancel{\\sin\\theta}\\cos\\theta  - ml \\cancel{\\sin\\theta} (D\\theta)^2}{2l\\cancel{\\sin\\theta}} \\\\\n\\lambda &amp; = \\frac{-1}{2l} \\left(mg\\cos\\theta - ml(D\\theta)^2\\right)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis further confirms what we showed in the previous section, that $\\lambda$ really is the composition function of the local state of the path. Also, to be noted here is the $2l\\lambda$ is a force – the sum of the outward component of gravity and the centrifugal force. This is the tension in the pendulum rod. It is effectively the force that is constraining the mass to stay at a constant distance from the pivot.\nBuilding systems from parts\n\nFigure 1.9: A compound spring-mass system is decomposed into two subsystems.\nWe can analyze compound systems using augmented Lagrangians to enforce constraints between the individual parts. Consider the compound spring-mass system at the top of Figure 1.9. One way to analyze this is as a single system with two coordinates $x_1$ and $x_2$ to represent the extension of the springs from their equilibrium lengths of $X_1$ and $X_2$.\nAn alternative procedure would be to break it into two parts – one being the spring-mass attached to the wall, and the other being the second spring-mass system with its attachment point specified by an additional coordinate $\\xi$ (which may have its own velocity). The Lagrangian for each part can be written separately. The Lagrangian of the combined system is the sum of the two component Lagrangians along with a constraint $\\xi = X_1 + x_1$ to ensure that the two systems are attached.\nSo the Lagrangian for the part attached to the wall is:\n\n    $$\nL_1(t; x_1; \\dot{x_1}) = \\frac{1}{2}m_1\\dot{x_1}^2 - \\frac{1}{2}k_1 x_1^2\\\\\n$$\n\nand the Lagrangian for the part that attaches to it is:\n\n    $$\nL_2(t; \\xi,x_2; \\dot{\\xi},\\dot{x_2}) = \\frac{1}{2}m_2(\\dot{\\xi} + \\dot{x_2})^2 - \\frac{1}{2}k_2 x_2^2\\\\\n$$\n\nCombining the two Lagrangians with the contact constraint, we get:\n\n    $$\nL(t; x_1, x_2, \\xi; \\dot{x_1},\\dot{x_2},\\dot{\\xi}) = L_1(t; x_1; \\dot{x_1}) + L_2(t; \\xi,x_2; \\dot{\\xi},\\dot{x_2}) + \\lambda(\\xi - (X_1 + x_1))\n$$\n\nThe Lagrange’s equations for the system are:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\nm_1D^2 x_1 = -k_1 x_1 - \\lambda \\tag{1.207} \\\\\nm_2(D^2\\xi + D^2 x_2) = -k_2 x_2 \\tag{1.208} \\\\\nm_2(D^2\\xi + D^2 x_2) = \\lambda \\tag{1.209} \\\\\n0 = \\xi - (X_1 + x_1) \\tag{1.210}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nFor eliminating $\\xi$ and $\\lambda$, substitute Eq. 1.210 into Eq. 1.209,\n\n    $$\nm( \\underbrace{D^2X_1}_{=0} + D^2 x_1 + D^2 x_2 ) = \\lambda\\\\\n$$\n\nSubstituting for $\\lambda$ in Eq. 1.207,\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\nm_1 D^2 x_1 &amp;= -k_1 x_1 - m_2 D^2 x_1 - m_2 D^2 x_2\\\\\nm_1 D^2 x_1 + m_2 (D^2 x_1 + D^2 x_2) + k_1 x_1 &amp;= 0\\tag{1.211}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSubstituting for $\\xi$ in Eq. 1.208,\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\nm_2(D^2 x_1+ D^2 x_2) + k_2 x_2 &amp;= 0\\tag{1.212}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEquations 1.211 and 1.212 are the equations of motion for the compound system. This is a general strategy that can be used to create a library of primitive components.\n\nEach component may be characterized by a Lagrangian with additional degrees of freedom for the terminals where that component may be attached to others. We then can construct composite Lagrangians by combining components, using constraints to glue together the terminals.\n\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-1-10-1-coordinate-constraints/","title":"Section 1.10.1: Coordinate Constraints"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-1-10-2-derivative-constraints/":{"body":"1.10.2 Derivative Constraints\nIn this section we look at a specific type of velocity-dependent constraints, which are “total-time derivatives” of a velocity independent function. The methods in Section 1.10.1 do not apply here as the constraint is velocity-dependent.\nLet this constraint $\\psi = 0$ be a velocity-dependent constraint. If $\\psi$ is a total-time derivative, this means that there exists some velocity-independent function, $\\varphi$ such that:\n\n    $$\n\\psi \\circ \\Gamma[q] = D(\\varphi \\circ \\Gamma[q])\n$$\n\nSince $\\varphi$ is velocity independant, $\\partial_2 \\varphi = 0$. The relationship between $\\psi$ and $\\varphi$ can be restated (as local-tuple functions) as:\n\n    $$\n\\psi = D_t \\varphi = \\partial_0 \\varphi + \\partial_1 \\varphi \\dot{Q}\\tag{1.214}\n$$\n\nWe can find $\\psi$ by solving this PDE. The constraint is defined as $\\psi = 0$. This implies that $\\varphi = K$ for some constant $K$. Conversely, if we know that $\\varphi = K$, then $\\psi = 0$ follows. Thus, the velocity-dependent constraint, $\\psi = 0$ is equivalent to the velocity-independent constraint, $\\varphi = K$. \nIf $L$ is the unconstrained Lagrangian, the Lagrange equations with the constraint $\\varphi = K$ are:\n\n    $$\n\\mathscr{E}[L] \\circ \\Gamma[q] + \\lambda(\\mathscr{E}[\\varphi] \\circ \\Gamma[q]) = 0\\\\\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a function of time that will be eliminated during the solution process. $K$ can be ignored here as $\\lambda(\\varphi - K)$ and $\\lambda(\\varphi)$ result in the same Lagrange equations. The function $\\varphi$ is independent of velocity and $\\partial_2 \\varphi = 0$. So we can use the same techniques from Section 1.10.1 to get the Lagrange equations for the system as:\n\n    $$\n\\mathscr{E}[L] \\circ \\Gamma[q] - \\lambda(\\partial_1 \\varphi \\circ \\Gamma[q]) = 0\\\\\n$$\n\nFrom Eq. 1.214, we can also infer that $\\psi$ is the partial of $\\varphi$ w.r.t velocity, or $\\partial_2 \\psi = \\partial_1 \\varphi$. Therefore, the Lagrange equations with the constraint $\\psi = 0$ can also be written as:\n\n    $$\n\\mathscr{E}[L] \\circ \\Gamma[q] - \\lambda(\\partial_2 \\psi \\circ \\Gamma[q]) = 0\\tag{1.218}\n$$\n\nThis is important because it shows that we can write the Lagrangian in terms of $\\psi$ without having to compute $\\varphi$, as long as we can show that $\\varphi$ exists. \nWe can also get the same result using the Augmetned Lagrangian technique. Consider the augmented Lagrangian below \n\n    $$\nL' = L + \\lambda' \\psi\\\\\n$$\n\nThe Lagrange equations for $L’$ are:\n\n    $$\n\\mathscr{E}[L'] \\circ \\Gamma[q] = -D\\lambda (\\partial_2 \\varphi \\circ \\Gamma[q]) \\tag{1.218}\n$$\n\nwhere $D\\lambda’ = \\lambda$. This shows that Eq. 1.218 and Eq. 1.219 are the same equations.\nThe technique defined in this section can be used for systems with constraints that can be written in terms of the derivative of a velocity-independent constraint. Such constraints are called integrable constraints. Any system where the constraints are coordinate constraints, or can be put in the form of a coordinate constraint are called holonomic constraints.\nGoldstein’s Hoop\n$$\\require{cancel}$$\n\nFigure 1.10: A massive hoop rolling, without slipping, down an inclined plane.\n“Goldstein’s hoop” is an example of a dynamic system with an integrable constraint: a hoop of mass $M$ and radius $R$ rolling down a one-dimensional inclined plane (Figure 1.10). This problem can be formulated in terms of two coordinates, $\\varphi$, the angular displacement of an arbitrary point on the hoop from some arbitrary reference line, and $x$, the linear progress of the center of the hoop down the plane. The cojnstraint is that the hoop rolls without slipping, or in other words, the change is $\\theta$ is directly reflected a change in $x$. The constraint function is:\n\n    $$\n\\psi(t; x,\\theta; \\dot{x},\\dot{\\varphi}) = R\\dot{\\theta} - \\dot{x} = 0\\\\\n$$\n\nThis constraint is represented as a relation between generalized velocities, which can be integrated to get $x = R\\theta + c$. This integrated constraint is a velocity-independent constraint. The augmented Lagrangian can be formulated in terms of the original constraint or its derivative.\nThe kinetic energy consists of the energy of rotation of the hoop (described later in Chapter 2 as $\\frac{1}{2}MR^2\\dot{\\theta}^2$) and the energy from the motion of its center of mass. The potential energy of the system decreses as the hoop proceeds down the slope. Thus the augmented Lagrangian is:\n\n    $$\nL(t; x,\\theta,\\lambda; \\dot{x},\\dot{\\theta},\\dot{\\lambda}) = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2\\dot{\\theta}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}M\\dot{x}^2 - (-Mg x\\sin\\varphi) + \\lambda(R\\dot{\\theta} - \\dot{x})\\tag{1.122}\n$$\n\nLagrange equations for this Lagrangian can be obtained as:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\nM D^2x - D\\lambda &amp;= Mg \\sin\\varphi \\tag{1.223}\\\\\nM R^2 D^2\\theta + R D\\lambda &amp;= 0 \\tag{1.224}\\\\\nR D\\theta - Dx &amp;= 0 \\tag{1.225}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nDifferentiating the third equation, we get \n\n    $$\nR D^2\\theta = D^2 x\\tag{1.226}\n$$\n\nMultiplying Eq. 1.223 by R and adding with Rq. 1.224\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &amp;= M R D^2x - \\cancel{RD\\lambda} - M R g \\sin\\varphi\n + M R^2 D^2\\theta + \\cancel{R D\\lambda} \\\\\n &amp;= \\cancel{M} \\cancel{R} D^2x - \\cancel{M} \\cancel{R} g \\sin\\varphi + \\cancel{M} R^\\cancel{2} D^2\\theta \\\\\n &amp;= D^2x + R D^2\\theta - g \\sin\\varphi \\\\\n &amp;= 2 D^2x - g\\sin\\varphi \\\\\n=&gt; D^2x &amp;= -\\frac{1}{2}g\\sin\\varphi \\tag{1.227}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis acceleration is just half of what the acceleration would have been for a point mass sliding down a frictionless inclied plane. Also notable is that the acceleration is independent of both $M$ and $R$. From the Lagrange equations, $D\\lambda$ can be interepreted as the frictional force that is causing the hoop to roll instead of slide. Combining Eq. 1.223 and Eq. 1.227, this force can be found to be:\n\n    $$\nD\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2} Mg \\sin\\varphi\\tag{1.228}\n$$\n\nand the angular acceleration $D^2\\theta$ is:\n\n    $$\n-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{g}{R}\\sin\\varphi\\tag{1.229}\n$$\n\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-1-10-2-derivative-constraints/","title":"Section 1.10.2: Derivative Constraints"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-1-10-3-non-holonomic-systems/":{"body":"1.10.3 Non-holonomic Systems\nSystems with constraints that are no integrable are called non-holonomic systems. A constraint is considered to be non-integrable if it cannot be written in terms of an equivalent coordinate constraint. One example of this is a ball rolling without slipping in a bowl, or any 2D surface. The ball may return to the same spot in the bowl, but its orientation when it gets there is entirely dependent on the path that it took to get there and may be completely different. So the constraint cannot be used to eliminate any coordinates.\nThere is no general solution for equations of motion governing nonholonomic systems. Her we can look at a restricted set of nonholonomic systems with constraints that are linear in velocities, i.e.\n\n    $$\n\\psi(t, q, v) = G_1(t,q)v + G_0(t,q)\\tag{1.230}\n$$\n\nWe assume that $\\psi$ is not a total time derivative. Based on some of the references in the book, if $L$ is the Lagrangian for the unconstrained system, the equations of motions are asserted to be:\n\n    $$\n\\mathscr{E}[L] \\circ \\Gamma[q] = \\lambda(G_1 \\circ \\Gamma[q]) = \\lambda(\\partial_2 \\psi \\circ \\Gamma[q]) \\tag{1.231}\n$$\n\nWith $\\psi = 0$, the system is completely specified and the evolution of its dynamics is defined. While Eq.1.231 is identical to Eq. 1.218 from the previous section, the derivation does not apply here since the assumptions made there do not hold. \nEq. 1.185 in Section 1.10 defines the condition that the variation $\\eta$ must satisfy in order for it to be consistent with the velocity-dependent constraint function $\\psi$. It is restated here:\n\n    $$\n(\\partial_1 \\psi \\circ \\Gamma[q])\\eta + (\\partial_2 \\psi \\circ \\Gamma[q])D\\eta = 0\\tag{1.185}\n$$\n\nWe can no longer eliminate $\\eta$ by the logic used in Section 1.10.1, because $\\eta$ is no longer orthogonal to $\\partial_1 \\psi \\circ \\Gamma[q]$ and we cannot rewrite the constraint as a coordinate constraint because it is not integrable by assumption.\nThe following derivation for of the nonholonomic equations is from Arnold et.al[6]. We define a “virtual velocity”, $\\xi$ to be any velocity satisfying the following condition:\n\n    $$\n(\\partial_2 \\psi \\circ \\Gamma[q])\\xi = 0\\tag{1.236}\n$$\n\nThe “principle of d’Alembert–Lagrange” states that:\n\n    $$\n(\\mathscr{E}[L] \\psi \\circ \\Gamma[q])\\xi = 0\\tag{1.237}\n$$\n\nfor any virtual velocity, $\\xi$. This could also be restated as “any virtual velocity $\\xi$ is orthogonal to $\\mathscr{E}[L] \\psi \\circ \\Gamma[q]$. We picked $\\xi$ to be arbitrary except that it be orthogonal to $\\partial_2 \\psi \\circ \\Gamma[q]$. Therefore, $\\partial_2 \\psi \\circ \\Gamma[q]$ must be parallel to $\\mathscr{E}[L] \\psi \\circ \\Gamma[q]$. So,\n\n    $$\n\\mathscr{E}[L] \\circ \\Gamma[q] = \\lambda(\\partial_2 \\psi \\circ \\Gamma[q]) \\tag{1.238}\n$$\n\nwhich are the non-holonomic equations. \nThe basic idea at the end is that the nonholonomic equations do not follow from the action principle. To quote the book:\n\nIt comes down to this: the nonholonomic equations do not follow from the action principle. They are something else. Whether they are correct or not depends on whether or not they agree with experiment.\n\nIn the previous sections, we showed how for systems with coordinate constraints or derivative constraints, the Lagrange equations can be derived from a Lagrangian that is augmented with the constraint. However, if we apply the same technique with non-holonomic constraints, the Lagrange equations obtained are not the same as Eq. 1.238 (or 1.231). For example, consider the following augmented Lagrangian:\n\n    $$\nL['(t; q,\\lambda; \\dot{q},\\dot{\\lambda})=L(t,q,\\dot{q})+\\lambda\\psi(t,q,\\dot{q}) \\tag{1.239}\n$$\n\nThe Lagrange equations associated with the coordinates are found to be:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &amp;= \\mathscr{E}[L]\\circ\\Gamma[q] \\\\\n  &amp;\\quad + D\\lambda(\\partial_2 \\psi \\circ \\Gamma[q]) + \\lambda D (\\partial_2 \\psi \\circ \\Gamma[q]) - \\lambda(\\partial_1 \\psi \\circ \\Gamma[q]) \\tag{1.240}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe Lagrange equation associated with tthe constraint is the constraint equation: $\\psi\\circ\\Gamma[q] = 0$. The equations here involve both $\\lambda$ and $D\\lambda$. The usual state variables, $q$ and $Dq$ and the constraint are not enough to completely specify the initial conditions for the dynamic system. We need to specify an initial value for $\\lambda$ as well (and possibly integrate it along with the states?). This reminds me of the Euler-Lagrange equations as applied to optimal control problems were we have a “costate” $\\lambda$ that is integrated along with the states. \n\nIn general, for any particular physical system, equations (1.231) and (1.240) are not the same, and in fact they have different solutions. It is not apparent that either set of equations accurately models the physical system.  The first approach to nonholonomic systems is not justified by extension of the arguments for the holonomic case and the other is not fully determined. Perhaps this indicates that the models are inadequate, that more details of how the constraints are maintained need to be specified.\n\n[6] V. I. Arnold, V. V. Kozlov, and A. I.

As an example, a pendulum can be modeled using just the angle of the pendulum from the vertical, or as a point mass with a constraint stating that it should stay a constant distance from the pivot point. The constraints described in this section are more general than the ones developed in Section 1.6.2.\nConsider a dynamic system with $n$ degrees of freedom, specified by $n+1$ coordinates, along with a path constraint of the form:\n\n    $$\n\\varphi(t, q(t), Dq(t)) = 0\\\\\n$$\n\nIn order to formulate the equations of motion, one approach would be to use the constraint equation to eliminate one of the coordinates, and then use the resulting irredundant coordinates to develop Lagrange’s Equations. Any equations developed using redundant coordinates with constraints should be equivalent.\nIn order to do this, consider the method used originally for deriving Lagrange’s equations. Realizable paths were those that had a stationary “action” compared to nearby paths. “Stationary” here means that the action does not change for small changes in the path. We considering constrained motion, these varied paths must also satisfy the constraints. This has some effects on the derivation of Lagrange’s equations. Regardless of the method used, the condition for stationary action condenses to the following form (Eq. 1.17 or Eq. 1.34):\n\n    $$\n0 = \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\{ (\\partial_1 L \\circ \\Gamma[q]) - D\\left( \\partial_2 L \\circ \\Gamma[q] \\right) \\} \\eta \\tag{1.182}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\eta$ is the variation in the path. In the unconstrained case, we may have arbitrary variations and so the only way for Eq.1.182 to be satisfied was for the integrand to be zero. Furthermore, since $\\eta$ can be arbitrarily chosen, the term multiplying with $\\eta$ must be zero for the action to be stationary, thereby getting to Lagrange’s equations. \nOnce we add in constraints, $\\eta$ can no longer be arbitrarily chosen. While the intgrand must still be zero for Eq. 1.182 to be satisfied, we can no loner conclude that the factor multiplying $\\eta$ must be zero. Therefore,\n\n    $$\n\\{ (\\partial_1 L \\circ \\Gamma[q]) - D\\left( \\partial_2 L \\circ \\Gamma[q] \\right) \\} \\eta  = 0 \\tag{1.183}\n$$\n\nwith $\\eta$ subject to the constraints of the dynamic system.\nA path $q$ satisfies the constraint if $\\bar{\\varphi}[q] = \\varphi \\circ \\Gamma[q] = 0$. Since we only allow varied paths that satisfy the constraint, the variation of the constraint must be zero:\n\n    $$\n\\delta_\\eta(\\bar{\\varphi}) = 0 \\tag{1.184}\n$$\n\n\nThe variation must be “tangent” to the constraint surface\n\nExpanding Eq. 1.184 with the chain rule (Eq. 1.26) and the definition $\\delta_\\eta \\Gammaq = (0,\\eta(t),D\\eta(t))$ (Eq. 1.31), the variation is tangent to the constraint surface if:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\delta_\\eta(\\bar{\\varphi}) &amp;= \\delta_\\eta( \\varphi \\circ \\Gamma[q]) \\\\\n   &amp;= (D\\varphi \\circ \\Gamma[q]) \\delta_\\eta\\Gamma[q] \\\\\n   &amp;= \\left(\\partial_0 \\varphi \\circ \\Gamma[q], \\partial_1 \\varphi \\circ \\Gamma[q], \\partial_2 \\varphi \\circ \\Gamma[q]\\right) \\cdot [0, \\eta, D\\eta] \\\\\n   &amp;= (\\partial_1 \\varphi \\circ \\Gamma[q])\\eta + (\\partial_2 \\varphi \\circ \\Gamma[q])D\\eta = 0\\tag{1.185}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThese are functions of time, so the variation at a given time is tangent to the constraint surface at that time.\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-1-10-constrained-motion/","title":"Section 1.10 : Constrained Motion"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-1-11-summary/":{"body":"Summary\nThis chapter was primarily introducing the Lagrangian method of analyzing mechanical systems. Here are some of the key points:\n\n\nTo start with, we need to distinguish between realizable motions and other possible motions of the system. This is achieved using the “action function”, which is constructed to be stationary only on paths that describe realizable motions, with respect to variations in the path. This is called the principle of stationary action or principle of least action and is the foundation of classical mechanics (and apparently electrodynamics, quantum mechanics and general relativity). The stationary action principle is a coordinate-independent description of realizable paths. Regardless of if the system has constraints, we may choose any system of coordinates that uniquely determines the configuration of the system.\n\n\nAn action is defined as the integral of a function, the Lagrangian along a path. For many mechanical systems, the appropriate choice for a Lagrangian is the difference between the kinetic energy and potential energy of the system. This is not unique and there may be many choices of valid Lagrangians for a given system. \n\n\nBy applying the Euler-Lagrange operator to the Lagrangian, we can derive a set of ordinary differential equations called the Lagrange equations that describes the motion of the system. Any realizable path saisfies these equations of motion. \n\n\nWe can add a “total-time derivative” to a Lagrangian without affecting the Lagrange equations of system\n\n\nThe entire time-history of a system can be simulated from a starting point with an initial state (which usually consists of the coordinates and the rate of change of the coordinates at the initial time) using these equations of motion\n\n\n\n\nIf there are continuous symmetries in a system, there are conserved quantities associated with that system (Noether’s theorem)\n\nIf the Lagrangian can be formulated such that the symmetries manifest as missing coordinates in the Lagrangian,  then there are conserved momenta that are “conjugate” to these coordinates\nIf the Lagrangian is independent of time then there is a conserved energy.\n\n\n\nConstraints in a dynamic system can be either holonomic or non-holonomic\n\nThe constraints can be added to the systems by augmenting the Lagrangian with the constraint function.\nWith Holonomic constraints, the “Lagrange multiplier” $\\lambda$ and redundant coordinates can be eliminated from the system and the dynamic equations formulated in terms of just the coordinates and velocities.\n\nHolonomic constraints are those which are either coordinate functions, or can be represented as coordinate functions (called integrable constraints)\n\n\nNon-holonomic constraints have a velocity dependency and systems with these constraints do not currently have a general solution\n\n\n\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-1-11-summary/","title":"Section 1.11: Summary"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-1-6-1-coordinate-transformations/":{"body":"1.6.1 Coordinate Transformations\nAssume we have a mechanical system whose motion is described by a Lagrangian that depends on time, position and velocities.

There is also a conserved quantity associated with the symmetry (Section 1.8). However, there are general symmetries that no coordinate systems can fully express. For example, motion around a central potential is spherically symmetric, i.e., the dynamical system is invariant under rotation about any axis. However, the Lagrangian for this system only demonstrates symmetry about a single axis. \nIn general, a Lagrangian is said to have a symmetry if there exists a coordinate transformation that leaves the Lagrangian unchanged.\nIn this section we consider the more general case of continous symmetries. A continuous symmetry is defined as a parametric family of symmetries. Emmy Noether proved that for any continuous symmetry, there is a conserved quantity.\nConsider a parametric coordinate transformation, $\\widetilde{F}$ with parameter $s$. This means that $\\widetilde{F}$ represents an infinite number of coordinate transformations, one for each value of $s$. \nAn example would be a function that takes an angle, $s$, as the input and spits out a coordinate transformation that rotates the primed coordinate frame, $x’$ about some axis by that angle.\n\n    $$\nx = \\widetilde{F}(s) (t, x')\n$$\n\nThere is a corresponding parametreic state transformation $\\widetilde{C}$ associated with $\\widetilde{F}$ that transforms the velocity $v’$ as well the time (i.e. the local tuple that forms the input to the Lagrangian).\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n(t, x, v) &amp;= \\widetilde{C}(s) (t, x', v') \\\\\n          &amp;= (t, \\widetilde{F}(t,x'),  \\partial_0 \\widetilde{F} + \\partial_1 \\widetilde{F} v', ...)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nWe require that $\\widetilde{F}(0)$ represent the identity transformation $x’ = \\widetilde{F}(0)(t, x’)$, with $\\widetilde{C}$ as the corresponding identity state transformation. If the Lagrangian $L$ has a continous symmetry corresponding to $\\widetilde{F}$, then the Lagrangian should be unchanged when the coordinates are transformed using $\\widetilde{F}$. Therefore:\n\n    $$\n\\widetilde{L}(s) = L\\cdot \\widetilde{C}(s) = L\\\\\n$$\n\nfor any $s$. Expanding $\\widetilde{C}$ in the above expression, we get:\n\n    $$\n\\widetilde{L}(s) = L\\left(t,\\quad\\widetilde{F}(s)(t, x'),\\quad\\partial_1\\widetilde{F}(s)(t, x')v' \\right)\\\\\n$$\n\nUndoing the “chainrule” in the second term and writing it in terms of the total time derivative,\n\n    $$\n\\widetilde{L}(s) = L\\left(t,\\quad\\widetilde{F}(s)(t, x'),\\quad D_t\\widetilde{F}(s)(t, x', v') \\right)\n$$\n\nNote: One of the assumptions in the following derivation is that $\\partial_0 L = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial t} = 0$\nThat $\\widetilde{L}(s) = L$ for any $s$ implies that $D\\widetilde{L}(s) = 0$ (where the $D$ operator represents derivative w.r.t $s$). Therefore, applying the chain rule for each of the components of $\\widetilde{L}$, the derivative of $\\widetilde{L}$ w.r.t $s$ is:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &amp;= D\\widetilde({L}(s)(t, x', v'))\\\\\n  &amp;= \\left(\\underbrace{\\partial_0 L}_{=\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial t} = 0} + \\partial_1 L(t, x, v)\\right) (D\\widetilde{F})(s)(t, x') + \\underbrace{\\partial_2 L(t,x,v) D(D_t\\widetilde{F}(s)(t, x')}_{\\text{can swap }D_t\\text{ and }D\\text{, as }D\\text{ w.r.t }s\\text{ is unstructured}} \\\\\n  &amp;= \\partial_1 L(t, x, v) (D\\widetilde{F})(s)(t, x') + \\partial_2 L(t,x,v) D_t(D\\widetilde{F}(s))(t, x') \\\\ \n  &amp;= (\\partial_1 L \\circ \\Gamma[q]) \\left( (D\\widetilde{F})(s) \\circ \\Gamma[q']\\right) + (\\partial_2 L \\circ \\Gamma[q])\\left( D_t(D\\widetilde{F}(s)) \\circ \\Gamma[q']\\right) \\tag{1.157}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAccording to Lagrange equations, the first term of Eq. 1.157 is: $(\\partial_1 L \\circ \\Gamma[q]) \\left( (D\\widetilde{F})(s) \\circ \\Gamma[q’]\\right) = (D_t\\partial_2 L \\circ \\Gamma[q]) \\left((D\\widetilde{F})(s) \\circ \\Gamma[q’]\\right)$. Substituting this in Eq. 1.157,\n\n    $$\n0 = (D_t \\partial_2 L \\circ \\Gamma[q])\\left( (D\\widetilde{F}(s)) \\circ \\Gamma[q']\\right) +  (\\partial_2 L \\circ \\Gamma[q])\\left( D_t(D\\widetilde{F}(s)) \\circ \\Gamma[q']\\right) \\tag{1.159}\n$$\n\nWhen $s = 0$, since $\\widetilde{F}(0)$ is the identity transformation, the paths $q$ and $q’$ are the same. Therefore, $\\Gamma[q] = \\Gamma[q’]$ and Eq. 1.158 becomes\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n0 &amp;= \\left ((D_t \\partial_2 L)(D\\widetilde{F}(0)) +  (\\partial_2 L)(D_t(D\\widetilde{F}(0)))\\right) \\circ \\Gamma[q] \\\\\n  &amp;= D_t ((\\partial_2 L) (D\\widetilde{F}(0))) \\circ \\Gamma[q] \\tag{1.160}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nTherefore the state function $\\mathscr{I}$:\n\n    $$\n\\mathscr{I} = (\\partial_2 L) (D\\widetilde{F}(0))\n$$\n\nis conserved along all solution trajectories. This quantity is called the Noether integral. It is the product of the momentum $\\partial_2 L$ and a vector associated with the symmetry.\nIllustration : Motion in a Central Potential\nConsider the motion of a particle in a central potential. The Lagrangian in rectangular coordinates is:\n\n    $$\nL(t; x,y,z; v_x, v_y, v_z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\left( v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2\\right) - U(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2})\n$$\n\nConsider a parameteric rotation about the $z$-axis:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{pmatrix} = \nR_z(s)(\\begin{pmatrix}x'\\\\y'\\\\z'\\end{pmatrix}) = \\begin{pmatrix}x' \\cos{s} - y'\\sin{s}\\\\x' \\sin{s} + y'\\cos{s}\\\\z'\\end{pmatrix}\n\\tag{1.163}\n$$\n\nSince a rotation is an orthogonal transformation, it does not change the magnitude of the vector,\n\n    $$\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x')^2 + (y')^2 + (z')^2\\\\\n$$\n\nSimilarly, differentiating Eq.1.163 along a path, we get:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{pmatrix}v_x\\\\v_y\\\\v_z\\end{pmatrix} =\nR_z(s)\\begin{pmatrix}v_x'\\\\v_y'\\\\v_z'\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nTherefore, $v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2 = v_x’^2 + v_y’^2 + v_z’^2$. Combining these, we can see that the post-transformation Lagrangian $L’$ is:\n\n    $$\nL'(t; x',y,z'; v_x',v_y',v_z') = \\frac{1}{2} m \\left( (v'_x)^2 + (v'_y)^2 + (v'_z)^2\\right) - U(\\sqrt{(x')^2 + (y')^2 + (z')^2\n})\n$$\n\nTherefore $L’$ is the exact same function as $L$ and hence there is a conserved value corresponding to the rotational symmetry about the z-axis. The momenta are defined as:\n\n    $$\n\\partial_2 L = [m v_x, m v_y, m v_z]\n$$\n\nand \n\n    $$\nD\\widetilde{F}(0)(t;x,y,z)=D\\widetilde{R}_z(0)(x,y,z) = [ y, -x, 0]\n$$\n\n\nNote about the $D$ operator\nThe $D$ operator has the highest precedence, and therefore:\n\n    $$\nD\\widetilde{F}(0)(t; x,y,z) = D\\widetilde{F}(s)(x, y, z)|_{s=0} = \\left.\\begin{bmatrix} -x \\sin{s} - y\\cos{s}\\\\x \\cos{s} - y\\sin{s}\\\\0\\end{bmatrix}\\right|_{s=0}\n$$\n\nHere we are taking the derivative w.r.t $s$ and consider $x$, $y$ and $z$ to be constants.

But this is driving towards some important results.\nWhen we were deriving the local-tuple transformation $C$, corresponding to a coordinate transformation $F$, the main factor was finding the relationship between the velocities in the two coordinate systems (e.g. $v$ and $v’$). We did this by inserting coordinate paths into the transformation function, $F$, finding its derivatives and then extracting out the velocity components.\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\nx &amp;= F(t, x') \\\\\n=&gt; v &amp;= \\partial_0 F + \\partial_1 F v'\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis last step is an example from a more general scenario where we want to abstract a local tuple function from a path function. Consider a function, $f$ of the local tuple. We typically apply $f$ to a path by composing it with $\\Gamma$. $\\Gamma$ is a function which extracts the local tuple from a path (the path itself is usually denoted computationally as symbolic coordinate functions like $x(t)$, $y(t)$ etc.). Given $f$, a corresponding path-dependent function $\\bar{f}[q]$ can be defined using $\\Gamma$ as $\\bar{f}[q] = f \\circ \\Gamma[q]$. The question now is given $\\bar{f}$, how can we reconstitute $f$. \nWe know that $f$ depends only on a certain finite number of components, $n$ of the local-tuple (say, $t$, $x$ and $v$). Therefore $\\bar{f}$ also depends only on the corresponding local components of the path. It is important to note that the path may be more complex than can be represented by $n$ components. Even so, the path-dependent function $\\bar{f}$ still has same value for all the paths that share the same first $n$ local components. \nBy “reconstituting” $f$, what we mean here is that we want to find the value of $f$ for some local tuple argument, when we only know the function definition of $\\bar{f}$. To do this, we take the argument of $f$ (which is a finite initial segment of the local tuple), constructing a path that has this local description (say, using a power series), and then finding the value of $\\bar{f}$ for this path.\nTwo paths that have the same $n$ initial components of the local tuple in its description (or “have the same local description up to the nth derivative”) are said to osculate with order $n$ contact. One example of this is a path, and a truncated power series representation of the path up to order $n$, have order $n$ contact. If we have a power-series representation of the path available up to $n$-th order, and a local tuple function takes fewer than $n$ components of the local tuple, then as far as this function is concerned, the path and the trunctated power series are equivalent. \nLet $O$ be a function that generates an osculating path with the given local tuple components, i.e.\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\nO(t, q, v, ...)(t) &amp;= q \\\\\nD(O(t, q, v, ...))(t) &amp;= v\\\\\n\\text{etc. and in general:}\\\\\n(t, q, v, ...) &amp;= \\Gamma[O(t, q, v, ...)](t)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n$O$ is defined to take a finite number of local tuple components, $n$. $O$ can be considered to be “inverse” of the $\\Gamma$ function. One caveat is that it only make sense to use $O$ when we have concrete expressions defining the entire local tuple of interest, rather than symbolic functions. One possible way of construction $O$ is using a power series:\n\n    $$\nO(t, q, v, ...)(t') = q + v(t' - t) + \\frac{1}{2} a (t' - t)^2 + ...\\\\\n$$\n\nSo, given a path function $\\bar{f}$, we can reconstitute the $f$ function as:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\nf(t, q, v, ...) &amp;= (f \\circ \\Gamma[O(t, q, v, ...)]) (t)\\\\\n                &amp;= \\bar{f}[O(t,q,v,...)](t)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nUsing this we can define $\\bar{\\Gamma}$ as a function that takes a path function and returns the corresponding local-tuple function, $f = \\bar{\\Gamma}[\\bar{f}]$.  $\\bar{\\Gamma}$ is defined as:\n\n    $$\n\\bar{\\Gamma}[f](t, q, v, ...) = \\bar{f}[O(t, q, v, ...)](t)\n$$\n\n$\\bar{\\Gamma}$ is defined in Clojure below. osculating-path is the implementation of the $O$ function.\n(defn osculating-path2\n    \"Defines a path function f(t) using a Taylor series about the time given in reference state\"\n    [state_ref]\n    (let [[t_ref q_ref] state_ref\n           N (count state_ref)]\n    (fn [t]\n      (let [dt (- t t_ref)]\n            (loop [n 2\n                   sum q_ref\n                   dt**n-by-n! dt]\n            (if (= n N) ;; exit loop when n == N\n                sum       ;; return sum\n            (recur (inc n)      ;; update loop variables and repeat\n                   (+ sum (* (nth state_ref n) dt**n-by-n!))\n                   (/ (* dt**n-by-n! dt) n)))\n)))))\n        \n(defn Gamma-bar2 [f-bar]\n    (fn f [local]\n        (let [t (first local)]\n            ((f-bar (osculating-path2 local)) t)\n        )\n    )\n)\n\n\nDespite it’s name Gamma-bar2 is not the inverse of $\\Gamma[q]$. $\\Gamma[q]$ takes a path, and returns a local tuple (the inverse of $\\Gamma[q]$ is actually $O$ which takes a local tuple and returns a path). Gamma-bar2 takes a function of a path, and returns a function of local tuples – this is a subtle but important difference. One operates on the path/tuple, and the other operates on functions of paths/tuples.\nGamma-bar2 can be used to define a more general version of the F-&gt;C function.  The procedure F-&gt;C first constructs a path-dependent procedure f-bar that takes a coordinate path in the primed system and returns the local tuple of the corresponding path in the unprimed coordinate system. It then uses Gamma-bar2 to abstract f-bar to arbitrary local tuples in the primed coordinate system. The resulting procedure C can take local tuples with n components in the primed coordinate system and generate local tuples of n terms in the unprimed coordinate system.\nE.g. p-&gt;r which is defined as:\n(defn p-&gt;r [[t, [r, phi], [rdot, phidot]]]\n  (let [x (* r (cos phi))\n        y (* r (sin phi))]\n    (up x y)\n  )\n)\n\np-&gt;r takes a local tuple in polar coordinates and returns a path in rectangular coordinates (NOT the local tuple). f-bar takes the input path q-prime in polar coordinates. Converts it into local tuple in polar coordinates using Gamma[q-prime]. This local tuple is then passed to p-&gt;r which returns a path in rectangular coordinates. This is then passed to Gamma to return the local tuple of n components in rectangular coordinates. Gamma-bar ensures that the input which consists of a polar local tuple of n components is converted to a path before being handed off to f-bar which then returns a local tuple of n components in rectangular coordinates.\nSo to summarize, p-&gt;r takes in a tuple and outputs a path or coordinate function in rectangular coordinates. However, instead of passing in a tuple directly to p-&gt;r, we pass in a path, and convert it into a tuple first by calling (Gamma q-prime). The output of p-&gt;r is then wrapped in Gamma &lt;&gt; n to extract n components of the local tuple out of this new path, which is then returned to the caller. This whole function is a path-dependent function that takes a path in polar coordinates as the input and spits out a local tuple in rectangular coordinates. Wrapping this in Gamma-bar makes it a function that instead takes a local tuple as input.\n(defn super-F-&gt;C [F]\n    (fn C [local]\n        (let [n (count local)\n              f-bar (fn [q-prime]\n                    (let [q (compose F (Gamma q-prime))]\n                        (Gamma q n)))]\n            ((Gamma-bar2 f-bar) local))\n))\n\n(defn p2r [[_, [r, phi], _]]\n  (let [x (* r (cos phi))\n        y (* r (sin phi))]\n    (up x y)\n  )\n)\n;; This can be demonstrated using the existing coordinate conversion \n;; function p-&gt;r which converts from polar coordinates to rectangular \n;; coordinates. Here it is shown operating on a local tuple with 4 terms.\n(rendertex\n  ((super-F-&gt;C p2r)\n   (up 't (up 'r 'theta) (up 'rdot 'thetadot) (up 'rdotdot 'thetadotdot))))\n\nThis is a very convoluted function at first look but also elegant in certain ways. My understanding is that we go through this roundabout way of path-&gt;tuple-&gt;path-&gt;tuple so that we can expand/contract the number of components of the path description that we are interested in. One example of this can be seen when applying F-&gt;C to the coordinate function which simply extracts the position out of the local tuple (it returns the same local tuple that was passed in). \n(rendertex\n  ((super-F-&gt;C coordinate)\n   (up 't (up 'r 'theta) (up 'rdot 'thetadot) (up 'rdotdot 'thetadotdot))))\n\n\n    $$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\\displaystyle{t} \\cr \\cr \\displaystyle{\\begin{pmatrix}\\displaystyle{r} \\cr \\cr \\displaystyle{\\theta}\\end{pmatrix}} \\cr \\cr \\displaystyle{\\begin{pmatrix}\\displaystyle{\\dot r} \\cr \\cr \\displaystyle{\\dot {\\theta}}\\end{pmatrix}} \\cr \\cr \\displaystyle{\\begin{pmatrix}\\displaystyle{\\ddot r} \\cr \\cr \\displaystyle{\\ddot {\\theta}}\\end{pmatrix}}\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe F function “contracts” (probably inaccurate terminology here) the local tuple that is passed in into just the position coordinates aka “path”. And to extract out more components from this, it is necessary to wrap the input in Gamma and the function itself in Gamma-bar.\nGamma-bar can also be used to compute the total time derivative $D_t F$ of the local tuple function $F$. \n\n    $$\nD_t (F \\circ \\Gamma[q]) = \\bar{\\Gamma}[ D(F \\circ \\Gamma[q]) ]\n$$\n\nNeed more explanation as to why this works\n\nGiven a procedure $F$ implementing a local-tuple function and a path $q$, we construct a new procedure (compose F (Gamma q)). The   procedure DF-on-path implements the derivative of this function of time. We then abstract this off the path with Gamma-bar to give the total time derivative.\n\nDt takes as input a function of the local tuple F and outputs a function of the local tuple. This function when evaluated for a some local tuple state, returns the time-derivative of F at that time. Dt is used to define the Euler-Lagrange operator in the next section\n(defn Dt [F]\n  (fn DtF [state]\n    (let [n (count state)\n          DF-on-path (fn [q]\n                    (D (compose F (Gamma q (- n 1)))))]\n      ((Gamma-bar DF-on-path) state)))\n  )\n\nLagrange equations “at a moment” or the Euler Lagrange operator\nThe Euler-Lagrange equations can be defined as a path-dependent function, $\\bar{\\mathscr{E}}[L][q]$, the operates on a path, $q$ and returns zero if it s feasible path (according to the Lagrangian $L$).\n\n    $$\n\\bar{\\mathscr{E}}[L][q] = D_t(\\partial_2 L \\circ \\Gamma[q]) - \\partial_1 L \\circ \\Gamma[q]\n$$\n\nThese path-dependent E-L equations can be converted to local-tuple function, $\\mathscr{E}[L]$ using Gamma-bar. \n\n    $$\n\\mathscr{E}[L] = \\bar{\\Gamma}(\\bar{\\mathcal{E}}[L]) \\\\\n$$\n\n$\\mathscr{E}[L] \\circ \\Gamma[q] = 0$ for realizable paths. $\\mathscr{E}$ is called the Euler-Lagrange operator.\n\n    $$\n\\mathscr{E}[L] = D_t \\partial_2 L - \\partial_1 L \\tag{1.180}\n$$\n\n(defn my-Euler-Lagrange-operator [L]\n  (- (Dt ((partial 2) L)) ((partial 1) L)))\n\n(defn L-harmonic [m k]\n    (fn [[_ q v]]\n        (- (* 1/2 m (square v)) (* 1/2 k (square q)))))\n\n(rendermd\n((my-Euler-Lagrange-operator\n   (L-harmonic 'm 'k))\n (up 't 'x 'v 'a)))\n\n(rendermd\n((compose\n   (Euler-Lagrange-operator (L-harmonic 'm 'k))\n   (Gamma (literal-function 'x) 4))\n 't)\n    )\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange operator takes in a Lagrangian function as input and directly create a new function which will define the Euler-Lagrange equations on passing in the local tuple. \nSummary\nThe functions/operators introduced in this section such as Gamma-bar, Dt and Euler-Lagrange-operator seem to be aimed at delaying evaluation as much as possible. We can stay in the realm of functions until the very end where we evaluate it on a local tuple to get the answer. Because these functions are eventually operating on paths, we need to make sure they are represented as path-dependent functions before transforming them. However, we wrap the path-dependant function in Gamma-bar at the end to make sure that we can still pass in the input as a local tuple.\nWhile there is still more I could understand about the mechanism/logic by which this is possible, this is where I will stop for now.\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-1-9-abstraction-of-path-functions/","title":"Section 1.9: Abstraction of Path Functions"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-2-1-rotational-kinetic-energy/":{"body":"2 Rigid Bodies\n\nThe polhode rolls without slipping on the herpolhode lying in the invariable plane.\nHerbert Goldstein, Classical Mechanics, footnote, p. 207.\n\n\n\nA rotating top - an axisymmetric body subject to gravity, with a point on the axis of symmetry that is fixed in space\n\nThe axis of the top precesses about the vertical, apparently moving perpendicular to the direction in which gravity is pulling it\n\n\n\nBook thrown into the air - has two stable configurations about longest and shortest axes.

Therefore, we define the position vectors based on a reference point on the body $X$. The position of each particle relative to the reference point can be represented by $\\xi_\\alpha$:\n\n    $$\n\\vec{x}_\\alpha = \\vec{X} + \\vec{\\xi}_\\alpha\\tag{2.2}\n$$\n\nThe corresponding velocities are given by:\n\n    $$\n\\dot{\\vec{x}}_\\alpha = \\dot{\\vec{X}} + \\dot{\\vec{\\xi}}_\\alpha\\tag{2.3}\n$$\n\nThe kinetic energy of the body can be rewritten as:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{\\alpha} \\frac{1}{2} &amp; m_\\alpha  (\\vec{X} + \\vec{\\xi}_\\alpha) \\cdot (\\vec{X} + \\vec{\\xi}_\\alpha) \\\\\n        &amp;= \\sum_{\\alpha} \\frac{1}{2} m_\\alpha  (\\vec{X} \\cdot \\vec{X} + \\vec{X} \\cdot \\vec{\\xi}_\\alpha  + \\vec{\\xi}_\\alpha\\cdot\\vec{\\xi}_\\alpha)\\tag{2.4}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIf we choose the center of mass of the body as the reference point,\n\n    $$\n\\vec{X} = \\frac{1}{M}  \\sum_{\\alpha} m_\\alpha\\vec{x}_\\alpha\\\\\n$$\n\nwhere $M = \\sum_\\alpha m_\\alpha$ is the total mass of the body, then\n\n    $$\n\\sum_{\\alpha} m_\\alpha\\vec{\\xi_\\alpha} = \\sum_\\alpha m_\\alpha (\\vec{x}_\\alpha - \\vec{X})\\tag{2.6}\n$$\n\nTaking the derivative of this, we can see that the relative velocities satisfy $\\sum_\\alpha m_\\alpha \\dot{\\xi}_\\alpha = 0$.

Choosing generalized coordinates such that the coordinates specifying the position of the center of mass is separate from those specifying the orientation, then the Lagrange equations completely decouple. This makes the dynamics of translation decoupled from that of translation.\nHowever, this is not true in the general case once potential energies are included in the system. So the motion of the center of mass and the rigid body may be coupled through the potential energy. However, in some specific cases, such as for example, a rigid body moving in a uniform gravitational field, the equations may decouple.\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-2-1-rotational-kinetic-energy/","title":"Section 2.1: Rotational Kinetic Energy"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-2-11-1-spin-orbit-coupling-potential-energy/":{"body":"2.11 Spin Orbit Coupling\n\nThe rotation of planets and natural satellites is affected by the gravitational forces from other celestial bodies. As an extended application of the Lagrangian method for forced rigid bodies, we consider the rotation of celestial objects subject to gravitational forces.\n\nIn this section, we will develop expressions for potential energy for the graviational interaction of an “extended body” (i.e. not a point mass) with an external point mass. Combined with the rigid body kinetic energy, this can be used to create Lagrangians that model a number of systems.\n2.11.1 Development of the Potential Energy\nThe rigid body can be modeled as a collection of particles subject to rigid constraints. Similar to the kinetic energy decribed in the previous section, the potential energy of a rigid body can also be expressed in terms of the moment of inertia and later expressed in terms of generalized coordinates.\n\nFigure 2.9 The gravitational potential energy of a point mass and a rigid body is the sum of the gravitational potential energy of the point mass with each constituent mass element of the rigid body.\nThe gravitational potential energy of a rigid body is the sum of the potential energies of the individual point masses that make up the rigid body.\n\n    $$\nV = - \\sum_\\alpha \\frac{G M' m_\\alpha}{r_\\alpha}\n$$\n\nwhere $M’$ is the mass of the external point mass that is the source of the gravity, $r_\\alpha$ is the distance from the point mass to the component particle in the rigid body and $G$ is the universal gravitational constant. The position of the component particle can be resolved as: \n\n    $$\n\\vec{r}_alpha = \\vec{R} - \\vec{\\xi}_\\alpha\\\\\n$$\n\nwhere $\\vec{R}$ is the vector from the external point mass to the center of mass of the rigid body. With this formulation, the distance to the particle, $r_\\alpha$ becomes, $r_\\alpha = R^2 + \\xi^2_\\alpha - 2R\\xi_\\alpha \\cos\\theta_\\alpha$, where $\\theta_\\alpha$ is the angle between the lines from the center of mass to the constituent particle and to the point mass (see Figure 2.9). \nGiven that this is a three-dimensional body, $\\xi_\\alpha$ and $\\theta_\\alpha$ cannot uniquely specify the p0osition of the constituent particle. However, these are the only parameters required to define the potential energy as it is simply a function of the distance between the particle and the distant point mass. The potential energy is therefore defined as:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nV &amp;= -GM' \\sum_\\alpha \\frac{m_\\alpha}{\\left(R^2 + \\xi^2_\\alpha - 2R\\xi_\\alpha \\cos\\theta_\\alpha\\right)^{1/2}}\\\\\n  &amp;= -GM' \\sum_\\alpha m_\\alpha \\left(R^2 + \\xi^2_\\alpha - 2R\\xi_\\alpha \\cos\\theta_\\alpha\\right)^{-1/2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n$$\n\nThis can be expanded using Legendre Polynomials. The Legendre polynomials $P_l$ may be obtained by expanding the expression $(1 + y^2 − 2yx)^{1/2}$ as a power series in $y$. The coefficient of $y_l$ is $P_l(x)$. The first few Legendre polynomials are: $P_0(x) = 1$, $P_1(x) = x$,  $P_2(x)=\\frac{3}{2}x^2−\\frac{1}{2}$ , and so on.

Each term in the series has an upper bound. This is because the Legendre polynomials all have a magnitude less than one for arguments between -1 and 1 (which $\\cos(\\theta_\\alpha)$ satisfies), and the distances $\\xi_\\alpha$ are all less than some maximum size $\\xi_{max}$. Therefore, the sum over $m_\\alpha$ times the upper bounds of each term is just $M$ times the upper bounds. Therefore,\n\n    $$\n\\left|\\sum_\\alpha m_\\alpha \\frac{\\xi^l_\\alpha}{R^l}P_l \\cos(\\theta_\\alpha)\\right| \\leq M \\frac{\\xi^l_{max}}{R^l}\n$$\n\nSuccessive terms decrease by a factor of $\\frac{\\xi_{max}}{R}$. A body with a sufficiently strong gravitational force overcomes the material strength of the rigid body and converts it into a sphere over time. The higher order terms in the series are measuring the deviation of the rigid body from a sphere. We can truncate the series to different values of $l$ based on the fidelity required.\nWhen $l=0$, the sum over $\\alpha$ gives the total mass $M$ of the rigid body. For $l=1$, the sum is zero because $\\vec{\\xi}_\\alpha$ is defiend relative to the center of mass.

Therefore, the potential energy of the body with terms up to $l=2$ is:\n\n    $$\nV = \\frac{-GM M'}{R} - \\frac{GM'}{R} \\left( A + B + C - 3I \\right)\\tag{2.98}\n$$\n\nThis is also called MacCullagh’s formula.\n\nFigure 2.10: The orientation of the rigid body is specified by the three angles from the line between the centers and the principal axes.\nFigure 2.10 shows a method for computing $I$ in terms of the principal moment of inertia.

However, the equations of motion derived for them have singularities. Though we can avoid the singularities by using other Euler-like combinations with different singularities, this kludge is not very satisfying.\n\n\n\nWe know from Euler’s theorem that any orientation can be reached with a single rotation. Specifying this rotation requires specifying its axis and the angle of rotation.\n\n\nOne possibility: Use latitude and longitude to define the axis. But this becomes undefined in the case of zero rotation\n\n\nAnother possibility: Use a vector whose direction is that of the axis vector and whose length defines the amount of rotation. In this case, rotation by $2\\pi$ is equal to no rotation at all. Every rotation can be represented by a countably infinite number of vectors, each with a length of $\\theta + 2M\\pi$ for an integer $M$. This makes it problematic to invert the mapping from other representations of rotation.\n\n\nA fix for the above point is to scale the vector by sine of half of the rotation angle. With this choice a rotation by zero angle will have the same orientation vector as a rotation by $2\\pi$. But there is still another problem: rotations by $\\theta$ and $2\\pi - \\theta$ are not distinguished. That is, a vector may represent both the “short-rotation” and the “long rotation” for the same orientation.\n\n\nWe can solve this by keeping track of the cosine of half the angle of rotation (though in reality we just need the sign of the cosine). Wrapping this all up into 4-tuples gives us Hamilton’s quaternions.\n\n\nFor a rotation by angle $\\theta$ about axis $\\hat{n}$, the components of a quaternion defining the rotation are:\n\n    $$\n(\\cos(\\theta/2),~\\sin(\\theta/2)\\hat{n}_x,~\\sin(\\theta/2)\\hat{n}_y,~\\sin(\\theta/2)\\hat{n}_z)\n$$\n\nThis is a unit quaternion as the sum of squares of its components is equal to one. The first element is called the “real part”, $r$, and the other three elements can form a tuple $v$ called the “imaginary part”. The angle of rotation can be obtained by computing $\\theta = \\arctan(|v|, r)$, and the axis direction is $v/|v|$.\n\nThe rotation represented by a quaternion is not changed by reversing the sign of all its components. This is because changing the sign of v reverses the axis but does not change the angle and changing the sign of the first component changes the angle $\\theta$ to $2\\pi − \\theta$, so the actual rotation is unchanged.\n\nDCM from Quaternion\nGiven the four elements of a quaternion, we can do compute the corresponding rotation matrix. First we get the angle $\\theta$ and axis, $\\hat{n}$ when given a quaternion. We rotate by angle $\\theta$ about the $z$ axis and then transform this rotation by a rotation to the axis specified by the colatitude ($\\varphi$) and longitude ($\\lambda$) of the axis $\\hat{n}$:\n\n    $$\n\\mathbf{R}(\\theta, \\hat{n}) = \\mathbf{R}_z(\\lambda)\\mathbf{R}_y(\\varphi)~\\mathbf{R}_z(\\theta)~\\mathbf{R}_y(\\varphi)^\\mathscr{T}\\mathbf{R}_z(\\lambda)^\\mathscr{T}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\varphi = \\arccos(\\hat{n_z})$ and $\\lambda = \\arctan(\\hat{n}_y, \\hat{n}_x)$.\n(defn my-angle-axis-&gt;rotation-matrix [theta n]\n  (let [nx (ref n 0)\n        ny (ref n 1)\n        nz (ref n 2)\n        colatitude (acos nz)\n        longitude (atan ny nx)]\n      (* (rotate-z-matrix longitude)\n         (rotate-y-matrix colatitude)\n         (rotate-z-matrix theta)\n         (transpose (rotate-y-matrix colatitude))\n         (transpose (rotate-z-matrix longitude)))))\n\n(rendermd (my-angle-axis-&gt;rotation-matrix (/ pi 4) (up 0 0 1)))\n\n\n    $$\n\\mathsf{matrix-by-rows}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix}\\displaystyle{0.7071067811865476} \\cr \\cr \\displaystyle{-0.7071067811865475} \\cr \\cr \\displaystyle{0}\\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix}\\displaystyle{0.7071067811865475} \\cr \\cr \\displaystyle{0.7071067811865476} \\cr \\cr \\displaystyle{0}\\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix}\\displaystyle{0.0} \\cr \\cr \\displaystyle{0.0} \\cr \\cr \\displaystyle{1}\\end{pmatrix}\\right)\n$$\n\n(defn quaternion-&gt;angle-axis [q]\n  (let [v (quat/three-vector q)\n        sintheta (sqrt (dot-product v v))\n        theta (* 2 (atan sintheta (quat/real-part q)))\n        axis (/ v sintheta)]\n    (up theta axis)))\n\n;; Quaternion to DCM\n(defn quaternion-&gt;DCM [q]\n  (let [aa (quaternion-&gt;angle-axis q)\n        theta (ref aa 0)\n        n (ref aa 1)]\n      (angle-axis-&gt;rotation-matrix theta n)))\n\n;; 30 degrees about z axis\n(render (quaternion-&gt;DCM (quat/make (cos (/ (/ pi 6) 2)) 0 0 (sin (/ (/ pi 6) 2)))))\n\n\n    matrix-by-rows(up(0.8660254037844387, -0.49999999999999994, 0), up(0.49999999999999994, 0.8660254037844387, 0), up(0.0, 0.0, 1))\n\nThe matrix terms here are all divided by the magnitude of $q$ which can be ignored since we use unit quaternions.

The diagonal components of the inertia tensor are the moments of inertia about the lines coinciding with the basis vectors.

However the kinetic energy must be the same regardless of the coordinate frame use. This fact can be used to derive how the inertia tensor transforms if the body or the coordinate frame are rotated.\nActive and passive rotations\nRotating the vector $\\vec{x}$ by the rotation $R$ produces a new vector $\\vec{x’} = R\\vec{x}$. $\\vec{x}$ may be written in terms of some arbitrary rectangular coordinate system with the basis vectors ($\\hat{e_1}$, $\\hat{e_2}$, $\\hat{e_3}$). Let $\\mathbf{x}$ represent the column vector components $x^0$, $x^1$ and $x^2$ fo the vector in this coordinate frame. Let $\\mathbf{R}$ be the matrix representation of the rotaton $R$ w.r.t the same coordinate frame. With these definitions, the rotation can be written as: $\\mathbf{x}’ = \\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{x}$. Since this rotation carries the vectors to new vectors, it is an active rotation.\nAlternately, we can rotate the basis vectors used to represent the vectors. While the vectors themselves may be unchanged, the components used to represent them are changed because the basis vectors are now in new orientations. If the new, rotated basis vector are represented by $\\hat{e}‘_i = R\\hat{e}_i$. The componenet along the rotated basis vector is the dot product of the vector $\\vec{x}$ with the new basis vector, that is: $(x’)^i = \\vec{x} \\cdot \\hat{e}’_i = \\vec{x} \\cdot (R \\hat{e}_i)$. \nSince the rotation of two vectors preserves the angle (and hence the dot product), between them, \n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\vec{x} \\cdot \\vec{y} &amp;= (R\\vec{x})\\cdot(R\\vec{y})\\\\\n=&gt; R^{-1} \\vec{x} \\cdot \\vec{y} &amp;= \\vec{x} \\cdot (R\\vec{y})\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nTherefore, \n\n    $$\n(x')^i = \\vec{x} \\cdot (\\mathbf{R} \\hat{e}_i) = R^{-1} \\vec{x} \\cdot \\hat{e}_i \\\\\n=&gt; \\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{R}^{-1} \\mathbf{x}\n$$\n\nThis type of rotation is called a passive rotation where the vectors were unchanged and the coordinate frame was rotated. For such a rotation, the components of a fixed vector changes as if it was actively rotated by the inverse rotation.\nTransformation of moments of inertia under rotation\nThe kinetic energy in terms of the coordinate frame $\\hat{e}_i$ is:\n\n    $$\nT = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum\\nolimits_{ij} \\omega^i \\omega^j I_{ij} \\tag{2.30}\n$$\n\nIn matrix notation, this can be written as :\n\n    $$\nT = \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\omega}^{\\mathscr{T}} \\mathbf{I} \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\tag{2.31}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ is the column vector containing the components of the angular velocity vector $\\vec{\\omega}$ in the $\\hat{e}_i$ coordinate frame. Applying a passive rotation $R$ to the coordinate frame gets us the new coordinate frame basis vectors $\\hat{e}’_i = R \\hat{e}_i$.

This means that $I^\\prime_{ii}$ is an eigen-value and $\\mathbf{e}^\\prime_i$ is the associated eigen-vector of $\\mathbf{I}$.\nSince $\\mathbf{e}^\\prime_i$ are the columns of a rotation matrix, and rotqtion matrix are orthogonal, the vectors themselves are orthonormal, i.e. they are unit vectors and their dot products with each other are zero. \nFor a real, symmetric matrix (like $\\mathbf{I}$). the eigen values are real. If the eigen values are distinct, then the eigen-vectors are orthogonal. However, if the eigen values are not distinct (say in the case of a symmetric body liuke a sphere), we have degrees of freedom on choosing the eigen vectors - and we may pick $\\mathbf{e}_i$ that are orthogonal. For example, for a cylinder, one of the eigen vectors(corresponding to the central axis) are distinct and the other two (corrsponding to the diameters of the circular faces) are equal. This means that any of the diameters can be considered an eigen vector.\nThis the rotated coordinate system has a special orientation with respect to the body. The basis vectors correspond to particular directions w.r.t the body. The axes through the center of mass in these directions are defined as the principal axes. Thus the moments of inertia about the principal axes are the eigenvalues $I^\\prime_{ii}$ and are called the principal moments of inertia.\nThe principal moments of inertia are often labeled according their size: $A \\leq B \\leq C$ with the corresponding axes: $\\hat{a}$, $\\hat{b}$ or $\\hat{c}$.

To quote the book:\n\nThough the Euler angles allow us to specify all orientations and thus can be used as generalized coordinates, the definition of Euler angles is pretty arbitrary. In fact no reasoning has led us to them. This is reflected in our presentation of them by just saying “here they are.” Euler angles are well suited for some problems, but cumbersome for others.\n\nWe start with the reference orientation so that principal-axis unit vectors $\\hat{a}, \\hat{b}, \\hat{c}$ are coincident with the basis vectors $\\hat{e}_i$, labeled here by $\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}, \\hat{z}$. The Euler angles are defined in terms of simple rotations about the coordinate axes. Let $R_x(\\psi)$ be a right-handed rotation about $\\hat{x}$ by angle $\\psi$, and $R_z(\\psi)$ be a right-handed rotation about $\\hat{z}$ by angle $\\psi$. The function $\\mathscr{M}$ for Euler angles is written as a composition of three of these simple coordinate axis rotations:\n\n    $$\n\\mathscr{M}(\\theta, \\varphi, \\psi) = R_z(\\varphi) \\circ R_x(\\theta) \\circ R_z(\\psi)\n$$\n\nfor Euler angles $\\theta, \\varphi, \\psi$. While these angles can represent any orientation, any specific orientation may be represented by more than one set of Euler angle. For example, when $\\theta = 0$, then the orientation does not uniquely define either $\\varphi$ or $\\psi$.\nThere are other sets of Euler angles that can serve as generlized coordinates.

For almost every initial condition the body components of the angular momentum periodically trace a simple closed curve.\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Trajectories of the components of the angular momentum vector on the principal axes, projected onto a plane. Each closed curve, except for the separatrix, is a different trajectory. All the trajectories shown here have the same energy\nThe above figure shows the components of the angular momentum vector on the principal axes for different initial conditions.  For most initial conditions we find a one-dimensional simple closed curve. Some trajectories on the front side appear to cross trajectories on the back side, but this is an artifact of projection. The family of trajectories appears to intersect at two points. The curve that is the union of these trajectories is called a separatrix; it separates different types of motion.\nThe state space for the motion of a rigid body is six-dimensional - the three Euler angles and their time derivatives. Noether’s theorem gives us four conserved quantities - the three components of angular momentum as well as energy. This means the motion only has two degrees of freedom. The numerical result above also shows that the three components of angular momentum trace one-dimensional paths.\nThe total angular momentum is also conserved as its components are conserved. That is,\n\n    $$\nL^2 = L_x^2 + L_y^2 +L_z^2\\tag{2.58}\n$$\n\nWhile the components themselves do not change, their projection on to the principal axes change as the axes themselves are in motion, attached to the body. The magnitude of $L$ should be the same even if evaluated in the principal axes coordinates. Therefore,\n\n    $$\nL^2 = L_a^2 + L_b^2 + L_c^2\\tag{2.59}\n$$\n\nPreviously, we found expressions for angular momentum and kinetic energy as:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\nT_R &amp;= \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ A(\\omega^a)^2 + B(\\omega^b)^2 + C(\\omega^c)^2\\right]\\tag{2.41}\\\\\nL_a &amp;= A\\omega^a\\\\\nL_b &amp;= B\\omega^b\\\\\nL_c &amp;= C\\omega^c\\tag{2.51}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThese can be combined to get the following expression for kinetic energy in terms of the components of $L$\n\n    $$\nE = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{L_a^2}{A} + \\frac{L_b^2}{B} + \\frac{L_c^2}{C} \\right)\\tag{2.60}\n$$\n\nEquations 2.59 and 2.60 constrain the motion of the components of angular momentum vector on the principal axes. Eq. 2.59 is the equation of a sphere and Eq. 2.60 is the equation of a triaxial ellipsoid. Since the angular momentum components satisfy both conditions, the component of the $L$ vector moves along the intersection of the angular momentum sphere and the energy ellipsoid. The intersection of a sphere and ellipsoid with the same center typically forms two closed curves.\n\n\nThe above equations were constructed with the assumption $A \\leq B \\leq C$. This means that the longest axis of the ellipsoid corresponds with the $\\hat{c}$ direction which is the principal axis with the largest moment of inertia. And similarly the shortest axis of the energy ellipsoid coincides with the $\\hat{a}$ direction (prinicipal axis for the smallest moment of inertia).\n\n\nThe intersection curves can be seen to shrink to a point for two axes, $\\hat{a}$ and $\\hat{c}$, corresponding to the principal axes with the largest and smallest moments of inertia, respectively. If the $L$ vector starts at these points, they tend to stay there. This is called an equilibrium point. Small displacements from this point at the start causes them to orbit the equilibrium point. This means that when the body rotates, the principal axes will describe a small orbit around the angular momentum vector in space (since the vector itself is constant). This is called a relative equilibrium. \n\n\nConversely, for the $\\hat{b}$ axis, or the intermediate axis, the curves appear to cross. This is also an equilibrium point. If the angular moment starts exactly at that point, it will stay at that point. However, if the system is slightly displaced, it tends to move away from the point very quickly. This denotes an unstable equilibrium point. So a body starting its rotation close to the intermediate axis will quickly end up in a tumble (while the $L$ vector still remains fixed in space).\n\n\nThis leads to the “intermediate axis theorem”, also known as the tennis racket theorem.\n\n\nNow consider the case where the rotating rigid body is somehow dissipating energy - maybe due to some flexing structural member. Since this is an internal process, this only decreases the energy while the angular momentum remains constant. This means that the intersection curve on which the system moves starts to deform. For a given $L$, there is a lower limit for energy. For this lowest energy state, the intersection is a pair of points on the maximum moment of inertia axis. This shows that with dissipating energy, a rotating rigid body ends up rotating around the principal axis of highest inertia - this is the lowest energy state consistent with a constant angular momentum. \n\nA simple “proof” of this can be obtained from Eq.2.60 . In order to minimize $E$, we need to increase the component of $L$ corresponding to the smallest scale factor, ($1/C$), while keeping the magnitude of $L$ constant. This can be achieved by maximizing the $L_c$.\nThis was what caused eventual failure of the Explorer 1 satellite. This same process happens at a larger cosmic scale with planets and moons.\n\n\n\n\nThe deviations from principal axis rotation for the Earth are tiny: the angle between the angular momentum vector and the ĉ axis for the Earth is less than one arc-second.\n\nThe above-mentioned deviations could be caused by Earthquakes, tides etc. In fact almost every other planet, asteroid and moon rotates about its principal axis with the largest moment of inertia. There are some exceptions - notably comets - which has reactions caused by the volatile jets that affect their rotation as they get closer to the Sun.\n\nAmong the natural satellites, the only known exception is Saturn’s satellite Hyperion, which is tumbling chaotically. Hyperion is especially out of round and subject to strong gravitational torques from Saturn.\n\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-2-8-2-qualitative-features-of-free-rigid-body-motion/","title":"Section 2.8.2: Qualitative Features of Free Rigid Body Motion"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-2-8-motion-of-a-free-rigid-body/":{"body":"2.8 Motion of a Free Rigid Body\nThe kinetic energy of a rigid body, expressed in suitable generalized coordinates, is a Lagrangian for its motion. In section 2.2 we showed that the kinetic energy of a rigid body can be separated into translational and rotational kinetic energy. If we use two separate sets of coordinats to represent the translation and rotation, the Lagrangian becomes the sum of a translational Lagrangian and a rotational Lagrangian. In this section, we will look at the rotational motion of a rigid body, modeled using Euler angles as the generalized coordinates.\nConserved Quantities\nSince the Lagrangian of a rigid body has no explicit time-dependence, we can infer that energy (i.e. kinetic energy) is conserved. The Lagrangian also does not depend on the Euler angle $\\varphi$ (since the expressions for the $\\omega$ vector did not depend on $\\varphi$ in section 2.7), and therefore its momentum conjugate (the component of $\\partial_2 L$ corresponding to $\\phi$) is conserved.

This can be verified by the Lagrangian formulation. The quantity computed above, $p_\\varphi$, can be shown to be the $z$ component of the angular momentum. This is verified below:\n(def L_z (ref ((rigid/Euler-state-&gt;L-space 'A 'B 'C) Euler-state)\n        2))\n\n(rendermd (- L_z momentum-phi))\n\n\n    $$\n0\n$$\n\nSimilar to the case of motion in a central potential, since the choice of coordinate frames is arbitrary, if one rectangular component of $L$ is conserved, then all of its components are conserved. Therefore, the vector angular momentum is conserved for a rigid body.\nThis fact can also be shown using Noether’s theorem. There exists a continuous family of rotations that can transform any orientation into any other orientation. The orientation of coordinate axes used to define the Euler angles are arbitrary and the kinetic energy (the Lagrangian) is the same regardless of choice of coordinate system. This meets the requirements of Noether’s theorem which tells us that there is an associated conserved quantity.\n\nIn particular, the family of rotations around each coordinate axis gives us conservation of the angular momentum component on that axis. We construct the vector angular momentum by combining these contributions.\n\nSee Exercise 2.11 for detailed proof of this (tbd .. will update link once completed).\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-2-8-motion-of-a-free-rigid-body/","title":"Section 2.8 : Motion of a Free Rigid Body"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-2-9-eulers-equations/":{"body":"2.9 Euler’s Equations\n\nFor a free rigid body we have seen that the components of the angular momentum on the principal axes comprise a self-contained dynamical system: the variation of the principal axis components depends only on the principal axis components.

These equations can be integrated witht eh initial conditions determined by the initial configuration matrix to get the evolution of the spatial orientation of the body. Combined with Euler’s equations, these equations completely definet the motion of a rigid body.\nHowever, having to integrate nine equations is rather cumbersome when we know that the orientation can be represented by just three states (the Euler angles). In order to reduce this to a system of three equations we can go back to parameterizing the rotation matrix with the Euler angles. We can form the matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ by composing $\\mathscr{M}$ with an Euler coordinate path (i.e. write it as the product of three rotation matrices, $R_z$, $R_x$ and $R_z$). We can then solve for $D\\theta$, $D\\phi$ and $D\\psi$ as:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nD\\theta \\\\ D\\phi \\\\ D\\psi\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta}\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos\\psi\\sin\\theta &amp; -\\sin\\psi\\sin\\theta &amp; 0\\\\\n\\sin\\psi &amp; \\cos\\psi &amp; 0 \\\\\n-\\sin\\psi\\cos\\theta &amp; -\\cos\\psi\\cos\\theta &amp; \\sin\\theta\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\\omega^a\\\\ \\omega^b\\\\ \\omega^c \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThese equations are singular for $\\theta = 0$, as expected. To quote the book:\n\nThe singularity in the equations of motion for $\\theta = 0$ does not correspond to anything funny in the motion of the rigid body. A practical solution to the singularity problem is to choose another set of Euler-like angles that have a singularity in a different place, and switch from one to the other when the going gets tough.\n\nEuler’s equations for forced rigid bodies\n$$\\require{cancel}$$\nIn this section, we derive Euler’s equations for a rigid body subject to an external torque. Consider a rigid body subject to some potential energy that is a function of time and configuration ($t$ and $q$). A suitable Lagrangian is $L = T - V$. If we use the 3-1-3 Euler angle set as the coordinates, the last of the three active rotations that define the coordinate is about the $z$ axis by the angle $\\phi$. The Lagrange equation for $\\phi$ is:\n\n    $$\nD \\partial_{\\dot{\\phi}} L = -D \\underbrace{p_\\phi}_{\\text{conjugate momentum of }\\phi} = \\partial_{1,1} V(t; \\theta(t), \\phi(t), \\psi(t))\n$$\n\nwhere $\\partial_{1,1}$ refers to a partial derivative with respect to a component (at index 1 or $\\phi$) of the coordinate argument of the potential energy function. If we define the torque component $T_z$, to be minus the derivative of the potential energy with respect to the angle of rotation of the body about the z axis, then,\n\n    $$\nT_z(t) = -D p_\\phi = \\partial_{1,1} V(t; \\theta(t), \\phi(t), \\psi(t))\n$$\n\nand so $D p_\\phi (t) = T_z$. Since the orientation of the coordinate axes are arbitrary, we may choose and orient them as we want. Thus if we want any component of the vector torque, we may choose the z-axis so that we can compute it in this way. Therefore the vector torque gives the derivative of the vector angular momentum (why?):\n\n    $$\nD\\vec{L} = \\vec{T}\n$$\n\nThis can be substituted in Eq. 2.65 with $\\mathbf{T}$ being the torque components in a column vector.\n\n    $$\nD\\overline{\\mathbf{L}} = \\overline{\\mathbf{T}} = D\\mathbf{M}~\\overline{\\mathbf{L}}' + \\mathbf{M}D\\overline{\\mathbf{L}}'\\\\\n$$\n\nSubstituting in $\\mathbf{I}‘\\boldsymbol{\\omega}’ = \\overline{\\mathbf{L}}’$, and $D\\mathbf{M}$ from Eq. 2.21c,\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{\\mathbf{T}} &amp;= \\left(\\mathscr{A}(\\mathbf{M}\\boldsymbol{\\omega}')\\mathbf{M}\\right)~\\mathbf{I}'\\boldsymbol{\\omega}' + \\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{I}'D\\boldsymbol{\\omega}'\\\\\n\\implies \\mathbf{M}^\\mathscr{T} \\overline{\\mathbf{T}} &amp;= \\underbrace{\\left(\\mathbf{M}^\\mathscr{T}  \\mathscr{A}(\\mathbf{M}\\boldsymbol{\\omega}')\\mathbf{M}\\right)}_{\\text{see Eq. 2.67}}~\\mathbf{I}'\\boldsymbol{\\omega}' + \\mathbf{I}'D\\boldsymbol{\\omega}'\\\\\n\\implies \\overbrace{\\mathbf{M}^\\mathscr{T} \\overline{\\mathbf{T}}}^{= \\overline{\\mathbf{T}}'} &amp;= \\mathscr{A}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}') \\mathbf{I}'\\boldsymbol{\\omega}' + \\mathbf{I}' D\\boldsymbol{\\omega}'\\\\\n\\implies \\overline{\\mathbf{T}}' &amp;= \\mathscr{A}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}') \\mathbf{I}'\\boldsymbol{\\omega}' + \\mathbf{I}' D\\boldsymbol{\\omega}'\\tag{2.82}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\overline{\\mathbf{T}}‘$ represents the torque vector components on the principal axes and $\\mathbf{I}’$ is the inertia tensor in the basis vectors of the principal axes. The angular velocity rates can be determined from Eq. 2.82 as:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\nA D \\boldsymbol{\\omega^a} - \\left(B - C\\right) \\omega^b \\omega^c &amp;= \\mathbf{T}_a\\\\\nB D \\boldsymbol{\\omega^b} - \\left(C - A\\right) \\omega^c \\omega^a &amp;= \\mathbf{T}_b\\\\\nC D \\boldsymbol{\\omega^c} - \\left(A - B\\right) \\omega^a \\omega^b &amp;= \\mathbf{T}_c\\tag{2.83}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe angular velocity components (on the principal axes) can be substituted by the angular momentum components on the principal axes as: $\\omega^a = \\frac{L_a}{A}, \\omega^b = \\frac{L_b}{B}, \\omega^c = \\frac{L_c}{C}$, to get:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\cancel{A} \\frac{D L_a}{\\cancel{A}} - \\left(B - C\\right) \\frac{L_b L_c}{BC} &amp;= T_a\\\\\n\\cancel{B} \\frac{D L_b}{\\cancel{B}} - \\left(C - A\\right) \\frac{L_c L_a}{CA} &amp;= T_b\\\\\n\\cancel{C} \\frac{D L_c}{\\cancel{C}} - \\left(A - B\\right) \\frac{L_a L_b}{AB} &amp;= T_c\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis simplifies into:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\nT_a &amp;= D L_a - \\left(\\frac{1}{C} - \\frac{1}{B}\\right) L_b L_c\\\\\nT_b &amp;= D L_b - \\left(\\frac{1}{A} - \\frac{1}{C}\\right) L_c L_a\\\\\nT_c &amp;= D L_c - \\left(\\frac{1}{B} - \\frac{1}{A}\\right) L_a L_b\\tag{2.80}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere the torque components on the principal axes can be obtained as: $\\overline{\\mathbf{T}}’ = \\mathbf{M}^{-1}\\overline{\\mathbf{T}}$. \nIt is to be noted that the torque does not affect the orientation directly, but instead only affects the angular momentum or angular velocity. Therefore Euler’s equations define the dynamics of the system while the derivatives of orientation define the kinematics of the system.\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-2-9-eulers-equations/","title":"Section 2.9: Euler's Equations"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/section-3-1-hamiltons-equations/":{"body":"3 Hamiltonian Mechanics\n\nNumerical experiments are just what their name implies: experiments. In describing and evaluating them, one should enter the state of mind of the experimental physicist, rather than that of the mathematician. Numerical experiments cannot be used to prove theorems; but, from the physicist’s point of view, they do often provide convincing evidence for the existence of a phenomenon. We will therefore follow an informal, descriptive and non-rigorous approach. Briefly stated, our aim will be to understand the fundamental properties of dynamical systems rather than to prove them.\n~ Michel Hénon, “Numerical Exploration of Hamiltonian Systems,” in Chaotic Behavior of Deterministic Systems [21], p. 57.\n\n\n\nThe formulation of mechanics with generalized coordinates and momenta as the dynamic state variables is called the Hamiltonian formulation. This is equivalent to the Lagrangian formulation, but present a differnet point of view. It is especially useful for understanding the evolution of a system, especially when there are symmetries and conserved quantities\n\n\nIn systems with symmetries, the conjugate momenta of “cyclic coordinates” (which do not appear in the Lagrangian) are conserved. This insight can be used to simplify and solve many problems in dynamics (e.g. spinning top). The Hamiltonian formulation is motivated by the desire to focus attention on the momenta.\n\n\nIn the Lagrangian formulation, the momenta are “secondary” quantities – they are functions of state variables and the evolution of these state variables only depend on the state variables themselves and not the momenta. Since the momenta can be inferred form velocities, it is possible to represent the dynamics in terms of coordinates and momenta. In such a formulation, if a momentum is conserved, it is immediately apparent from its dynamic equation.\n\n\nMechanical systems can exhibit simple or complex behavior - periodic motion, chaotic motion etc. Sometimes the periodicity may be driven by an external force. The Hamiltonian formulation of dynamics provides a convenient framework in which the possible motions may be placed and understood. We will be able to see the range of stable resonance motions and the range of states reached by chaotic trajectories, and discover other unsuspected possible motions.\n\n\n3.1 Hamilton’s Equations\n$\\require{cancel}$\nRestricting our attention to Lagrangians that only depend onf time, coordinates and velocities, the momenta in a system can be represented as functions of coordinates, velocities and time. It is possible to invert these functions to get a local representation of velocity in terms of time, coordinates and momenta. The equations of motion when recast in terms of coordinates and momenta are called Hamilton’s canonical equations. We will look at three derivations of these equations: \n\n\nThe first strategy is an expansion of the one described in the above paragraph - starting with  inverting the momentum state function.\n\n\nThe second derivation in Section 3.1.1 first abstracts a key part of the first derivation and then applies the more abstract machinery to derive Hamilton’s equations. The third (section 3.1.2) uses the action principle.\n\n\nThe equations for the time derivative of a momentum can be found from Lagrange’s equations as:\n\n    $$\nD{p}(t) = \\partial_1 L(t, q(t),D{q}(t))\\tag{3.1}\n$$\n\nwhere (by definition of generalized momenta),\n\n    $$\np(t) = \\partial_2 L(t, q(t), Dq(t))\\tag{3.2}\n$$\n\nTo eliminate $Dq(t)$ from Eq. 3.1, we need to invert Eq.3.2. To avoid confusion, we will do this by assigning simple variable names to the function arguments and its output. If Eq.3.1 is restated as:\n\n    $$\na = \\partial_2 L (b, c, d)\\tag{3.3}\n$$\n\nThen the equation can be inverted in terms of the third argument to get the new function $\\mathscr{V}$ so that:\n\n    $$\nd = \\mathscr{V}(b, c, a)\\tag{3.4}\n$$\n\nSubstituting $a$ from Eq. 3.3 in 3.4 (and $d$ in Eq. 3.3), \n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\nd = \\mathscr{V}(b, c, \\partial_2 L(b, c, d))\\tag{3.5}\\\\\na = \\partial_2 L(b, c, \\mathscr{V}(b, c, a))\\tag{3.6}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nTHis pattern can be applied to Eq. 3.1 to get:\n\n    $$\nDp(t) = \\partial_1 L (t, q(t), \\mathscr{V}(t, q(t), p(t)))\\tag{3.7}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, Eq. 3.2 can be inverted to get:\n\n    $$\nDq(t) = \\mathscr{V}(t, q(t), \\partial_1 L(t, q(t), Dq(t))\\tag{3.8}\n$$\n\nEquations 3.7 and 3.8 give dynamic equations for $q$ and $p$ as functions of time, coordinates and momenta. To represent this better, we can define a new Lagrangian as a function of time, coordinates and momenta.\n\n    $$\n\\widetilde{L}(t, q, p) = L(t, q, \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p))\n$$\n\n\nHere we are using mnemonic names t, q, p for formal parameters of the function being defined. We could have used names like a, b, c as above, but this would have made the argument harder to read.\n\nTo get the equations of motion, we need to compute $\\partial_1 L$ (applying the chain rule, assuming that $L$ is not an explicit function of time):\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\partial_1 \\widetilde{L}(t, q, \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p)) &amp;= \\partial_1 L (t, q, \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p)) + \\overbrace{\\partial_2 L (t, q, \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p))}^{=p~\\text{from Eq 3.2}}\\partial_1 \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p)\\\\\n &amp;= \\partial_1 L (t, q, \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p)) + p \\partial_1 \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p)\\tag{3.10}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nWe introduce the “momentum selector” function here, $P(t,q,p) = p$ such that $\\partial_1 P = 0$ to get,\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\partial_1 L (t, q, \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p)) &amp;= \\partial_1 \\widetilde{L}(t, q, p) - p \\partial_1 \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p)\\\\\n           &amp;= \\partial_1 \\widetilde{L}(t, q, p) - P(t, q, p)\\partial_1 \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p)\\\\\n           &amp;= -\\partial_1 H(t, q, p)\\tag{3.11}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIn Eq. 3.11, $H$ is the Hamiltonian defined as:\n\n    $$\nH = P\\mathscr{V} - \\widetilde{L}\\tag{3.12}\n$$\n\nSubstituing Eq. 3.11 in 3.7, we get the dynamic equation for momentum as:\n\n    $$\nDp(t) = -\\partial_1 H(t, q(t), p(t))\\tag{3.11}\n$$\n\nThe equation for $Dq(t)$ can also be written in terms of the Hamiltonian as shown below:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\partial_2 H (t, q, p) &amp;= \\partial_2 (P\\mathscr{V} - \\widetilde{L})(t, q, p)\\\\\n           &amp;= \\overbrace{\\partial_2 P(t, q, p)}^{=1} \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p) + \\overbrace{P(t, q, p)}^{=p} \\partial_2 \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p) - \\partial_2 \\widetilde{L}(t, q, p)\\\\\n           &amp;= \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p) + p\\partial_2 \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p) - \\partial_2 \\widetilde{L}(t, q, p)\\tag{3.14}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n$\\partial_2 \\widetilde{L}$ can be computed using the chain rule as:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\partial_2 \\widetilde{L}(t, q, p) &amp;= \\partial_2 \\left(L(t, q, \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p))\\right)\\\\\n    &amp;= \\partial_2 L(t, q, \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p)) \\partial_2 \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p)\\\\\n    &amp;= p \\partial_2\\mathscr{V}(t, q, p)\\tag{3.15}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nEq. 3.14 now reduces to: $\\partial_2 H (t, q, \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p)) = \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p) + \\cancel{p\\partial_2 \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p)} - \\cancel{p\\partial_2 \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p)} = \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p)$.  This can be substituted in Eq. 3.8 to get:\n\n    $$\nDq(t) = \\partial_2 H (t, q, \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p))\\tag{3.17}\n$$\n\nEquations 3.13 and 3.17 are called Hamilton’s equations.\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\nDq(t) &amp;= \\partial_2 H (t, q, \\mathscr{V}(t, q, p))\\\\\nDp(t) &amp;= -\\partial_1 H(t, q(t), p(t))\\tag{3.18}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe first equation in 3.18 is restating the relation between velocity and momenta in terms of the Hamiltonian and applies for all paths regardless of whether they are realizable. The second equation only applies for realizable paths. The Hamiltonian has the same value as the energy function $\\mathscr{E}$ from Chapter 1. The only difference is that that the velocities are expressed in terms of time, coordinates, and momenta using $\\mathscr{V}$:\n\n    $$\nH(t, q, p) = \\mathscr{E}(t, q, \\mathscr{V}(t,q,p))\\tag{3.20}\n$$\n\nIllustration using free particle\nThe Lagrangian for the motion of a free-particle of mass $m$ is:\n\n    $$\nL(t; x,y; v_x,v_y) = \\frac{1}{2} m (v_x^2 + v_y^2) - V(x, y)\n$$\n\nTo compute the Hamiltonian, we first ocmpute the momenta as $p = \\partial_2 L; p_x = mv_x; p_y = mv_y$. Solving for velocities, we get,\n$v_x = p_x/m, v_y = p_y/m$ (This is the definition of $\\mathscr{V}$). The Hamiltonian is $H = pv - L(t,q,v)$ with $v$ expressed in terms of $(t, q, p)$.\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\nH &amp;= p_x\\frac{p_x}{m} + p_y\\frac{p_y}{m} - L = \\frac{p_x^2 + p_y^2}{m} - \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{p_x^2 + p_y^2}{m} + V(x,y)\\\\\n  &amp;= \\frac{p_x^2 + p_y^2}{2m} + V(x, y)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis is the total energy $T + V$ expressed in terms of the momenta.  Hamilton’s equations for $Dq(t)$ are:\n\n    $$\nD_x(t) = p_x(t)/m \\quad D_y(t) = p_y(t)/m\\\\\n$$\n\nThe Hamilton’s equations for the momenta are:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\nDp_x(t) &amp;= -\\partial_{p_x} H = -\\partial_0 V(x(t), y(t))\\\\\nDp_y(t) &amp;= -\\partial_{p_y} H = -\\partial_1 V(x(t), y(t))\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHamiltonian State\nGiven a coordinate path $q$ and a Lagrangian $L$, the corresponding momentum path $p$ is given by Eq. 3.2. This can also be represented in terms of the Hamiltonian as was shown in the section above. The expression for momntum is valid whether or not the path is realizable, i.e., $p = \\partial_2 L(t, q, v)$. In the Lagrangian formulation, $(t, q, v)$ represents the state of the path at a given moment and Lagrange’s equations describe a unique path emnating from this state. Similarly, $(t, q, p)$ represents the starte of a path in the Hamiltonian formulation and Hamilton’s equations describe a path emnating from this state. The two formulations are equivalent and creates the same path for the a given initial state.\nWhen converting Lagrange equations into first order ODEs (prior to integration), we need to invert $ \\partial_2 \\partial_2 L$. While Hamilton’s equations are already first order ODEs, their construction involves an inversion in the form of the function $\\mathscr{V}$. A system that is non-invertible in the Lagrangian formulation remains so in the Hamiltonian formulation as well. \nFor any given path, $q$, the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian state paths can be deduced from it. For the Lagrangian formulation, the state path is given by:\n\n    $$\n\\Gamma[q](t) = (t, q(t), Dq(t))\n$$\n\nThe construction of the Hamiltonian path requires the definition of a Lagrangian. The Hamiltonian path is given by:\n\n    $$\n\\Pi_L[q](t) = (t, q(t), \\partial_2 L(t, q(t), Dq(t))) = (t, q(t), p(t))\n$$\n\nThe Hamiltonian state path is not unique for a given path as it is dependent on the Lagrangian that we choose when formulating it. There is no unique choice for the Lagrangian and hence there is no unique Hamiltonian state path for a given path.\n\nThe $2n$-dimensional space whose elements are labeled by the n generalized coordinates $q^i$ and the $n$ generalized momenta $p_i$ is called the phase space. The components of the generalized coordinates and momenta are collectively called the phase-space components. The dynamical state of the system is completely specified by the phase-space state tuple $(t, q, p)$, given a Lagrangian or Hamiltonian to provide the map between velocities and momenta.\n\nComputing Hamilton’s Equations\n;; Implementation of Hamilton's Equations\n(defn qp-&gt;H-state-path [q p]\n    (fn [t]\n      (up t (q t) (p t))))\n\n(defn my-Hamiltonian-&gt;state-derivative [Hamiltonian]\n    (fn [H-state]\n      (up 1\n          (((partial 2) Hamiltonian) H-state)\n          (- (((partial 1) Hamiltonian) H-state)))))\n\n(defn my-Hamilton-equations [Hamiltonian]\n    (fn [q p]\n        (let [state-path (qp-&gt;H-state-path q p)]\n            (- (D state-path)\n               (compose (my-Hamiltonian-&gt;state-derivative Hamiltonian)\n                state-path)))))\n\n#'user/my-Hamilton-equations\n\n;; Free particle Hamtiltonian\n(defn H-rectangular [m V]\n    (fn [state]\n      (let [q (coordinate state)\n            p (momentum state)]\n            (+ (/ (square p) (* 2 m))\n               (V (ref q 0) (ref q 1))))))\n\n(rendermd (let [V (literal-function 'V (-&gt; (X Real Real) Real))\n        q (up (literal-function 'x)\n               (literal-function 'y))\n        p (down (literal-function 'p_x)\n                 (literal-function 'p_y))]\n    (((Hamilton-equations (H-rectangular 'm V)) q p) 't)))\n\n\n    $$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\\displaystyle{0} \\cr \\cr \\displaystyle{\\begin{pmatrix}\\displaystyle{\\frac{m\\,Dx\\left(t\\right) - p_x\\left(t\\right)}{m}} \\cr \\cr \\displaystyle{\\frac{m\\,Dy\\left(t\\right) - p_y\\left(t\\right)}{m}}\\end{pmatrix}} \\cr \\cr \\displaystyle{\\begin{bmatrix}\\displaystyle{Dp_x\\left(t\\right) + \\partial_0V\\left(x\\left(t\\right), y\\left(t\\right)\\right)} \\cr \\cr \\displaystyle{Dp_y\\left(t\\right) + \\partial_1V\\left(x\\left(t\\right), y\\left(t\\right)\\right)}\\end{bmatrix}}\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n\nThe zero in the first element of the structure of Hamilton’s equation residuals is just the tautology that time advances uniformly: the time function is just the identity, so its derivative is one and the residual is zero.

To show that the Euler angles are adequate to represent all orientations, solve for the Euler angles that give an arbitrary rotation $R$. Keep in mind that some orientations do not correspond to a unique representation in terms of Euler angles.\nWe will solve this for the “3-1-3” euler angles which involves an initial rotation around the $z$ axis, followed by the $x$ axis and then the $z$ axis again. \nFrom Section 2.7, we know that rotations about $z$ and $x$ axes can be represented as: \n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{R}_z(\\psi) &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix}\n              \\cos\\psi &amp; -\\sin\\psi &amp; 0\\\\\n              \\sin\\psi &amp; \\cos\\psi &amp; 0\\\\\n              0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\\n             \\end{bmatrix}\\\\\n\\mathbf{R}_x(\\psi) &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix}\n              1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\\n              0 &amp; \\cos\\psi &amp; -\\sin\\psi\\\\\n              0 &amp; \\sin\\psi &amp; \\cos\\psi\\\\\n             \\end{bmatrix}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe rotation $R$ can then be represented in matrix form as:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{R}_{zxz}(\\theta, \\varphi, \\psi) = \\mathbf{R}_z(\\varphi) \\mathbf{R}_x(\\theta) \\mathbf{R}_z(\\psi)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nExpanding this matrix multiplication, we can get the matrix $\\mathbf{R}_{zxz}$ as a function of $(\\theta, \\varphi, \\psi)$\nt = symbols('t', real=True)\ntheta, phi, psi = symbols('theta phi psi', real=True)\n\nRz = Matrix([[cos(t), -sin(t), 0],\n             [sin(t), cos(t), 0],\n             [0, 0, 1]])\n\nRx = Matrix([[1, 0, 0],\n             [0, cos(t), -sin(t)],\n             [0, sin(t), cos(t)]])\n\nR_zxz = Rz.subs(t, phi) * Rx.subs(t, theta) * Rz.subs(t, psi)\nR_zxz\n\n\n    $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}- \\sin{\\left(\\phi \\right)} \\sin{\\left(\\psi \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta \\right)} + \\cos{\\left(\\phi \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\psi \\right)} &amp; - \\sin{\\left(\\phi \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\psi \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta \\right)} - \\sin{\\left(\\psi \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\phi \\right)} &amp; \\sin{\\left(\\phi \\right)} \\sin{\\left(\\theta \\right)}\\\\\\sin{\\left(\\phi \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\psi \\right)} + \\sin{\\left(\\psi \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\phi \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta \\right)} &amp; - \\sin{\\left(\\phi \\right)} \\sin{\\left(\\psi \\right)} + \\cos{\\left(\\phi \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\psi \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta \\right)} &amp; - \\sin{\\left(\\theta \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\phi \\right)}\\\\\\sin{\\left(\\psi \\right)} \\sin{\\left(\\theta \\right)} &amp; \\sin{\\left(\\theta \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\psi \\right)} &amp; \\cos{\\left(\\theta \\right)}\\end{matrix}\\right]$\n\nAny proper rotation can be represented by the rotation matrix $\\mathbf{R}$ where\n\n    $$\n\\mathbf{R} = \\begin{bmatrix}R_{11} &amp; R_{12} &amp; R_{13}\\\\\nR_{21} &amp; R_{22} &amp; R_{23}\\\\\nR_{31} &amp; R_{32} &amp; R_{33}\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nComparing $\\mathbf{R}$ and $\\mathbf{R}_{zxz}$, we get\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\cos{\\theta} &amp;= R_{33} \\implies \\theta = \\arccos{(R_{33})}\\\\\n\\sin(\\phi)\\sin(\\theta) &amp;= R_{13}\\\\\n-\\cos(\\phi)\\sin(\\theta) &amp;= R_{23}\\\\\n\\sin{(\\theta)}\\cos{(\\psi)} &amp;= R_{32}\\\\\n\\sin{(\\theta)}\\sin{(\\psi)} &amp;= R_{31}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nWe can therefore compute $(\\theta, \\phi, \\psi)$ for a given arbitrary rotation. The particular set of Euler angles chosen may have coordinate singularities. For example, in the z-x-z Euler angle set chosen above, when $\\theta = 0$, $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are not defined. However, in this case, another set of Euler angles may be chosen that does not have a singularity in that particular configuration.\nWe have shown above that any arbitrary rotation, as represented by a direction cosine matrix, can be written in terms of Euler angles. This proves that Euler angles can represent any arbitrary rotation.\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/sicm-workbook/sicm-exercise-2-9/","title":"Exercise 2.9: Euler angles"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/todo-list/":{"body":"This is the ever growing list of books/topics that I want to pick up next\nBooks to study\n\nFunctional Differential Geometry\nThe Variational Principles of Mechanics\n\nTopics\n\nElectrodynamics\nGeneral Relativity\nQuantum Mechanics\nJulia programming language\n\nOther interesting books/courses/stuff to investigate\n\nNonlinear Dynamics: A Concise Introduction Interlaced with Code\nIntroduction to Computational Thinking aka Julia: A Fresh Approach to Computing\n\n","id":"https://www.thomasantony.com/projects/todo-list/","title":"Reading/Study To-Do List"},"https://www.thomasantony.com/publications/":{"body":"Journal Articles and Conference Proceedings\n\n\nRapid Indirect Trajectory Optimization on Highly Parallel Computing Architectures\nAntony, T., and Grant, M.
