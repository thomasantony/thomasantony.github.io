I love the flexibility, the clean and readable syntax and its huge ecosystem of libraries. However, when it comes to making modern GUIs, it comes up sort in many ways.\nThere are libraries like PyQT and Kivy to create GUIs for your Python application. However, each of them come with their own problems. Many modern UI solutions like Electron and React-Native looks to the web to avoid the problems of dealing with multiple platforms. After all, the web is one platform that DOES have it’s share of great (and at times awful) UIs.\nflybywire is my ongoing experiment to develop a declarative UI library, based off some great work by Cristian Medina. So, what is flybywire all about? Well, you need a bit of background before I can go into that.\nReact, ES6 and the Endless&nbsp;Abyss\nReact caught my interest sometime late last year when I was trying to build a desktop frontend for a Python project using Electron. I was coming back to web development after a gap of nearly six years and my last experience in the field was with jQuery and PHP.\nAfter finishing a basic tutorial, I was really excited about the possibilities of React. However, that excitement was a little dulled once I discovered the wonderful world of node-based tools that seemed almost mandatory if you wanted to create anything serious. I found that javascript is no longer the innocent, interpreted language I knew it as. ES6, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, transpilers, webpack, the endless abyss that is node-packages&nbsp;… it is easy to get lost just trying to get a hang of all these tools and frameworks.\nSo where am I going with all this? Well, my (mis?)adventures with React, Redux etc. can be summarized as:\n\nReact seems to have zeroed in on a really good way of defining UIs without much clutter. I especially loved the concept of one-way binding and views defined as pure functions of state which redraws the whole page when updated.\nI found redux to be a great addition to the React ecosystem that provides clean and predictable state management along with some very fancy debugging features.\nA Python programmer who wants to use React or Electron still has to navigate through the very confusing tooling (npm, webpack, babel etc.) before they can even start to create anything useful.\nI don’t want to deal with Javascript to design my UI.\n\nThere has to be a way to do all this in Python!\nThe Magic of Websockets\nLast week, I came across this article which seemed to reflect many of the problems that I had faced when it came to Python GUIs. The article is part of a 3-part (so far) series that ends with the creation of Sofi (Cheers Cristian!). As described in the article, Sofi is:\n\na system that will generate the necessary HTML and JavaScript code typically needed to produce a single-page application and serve it up through WebSockets\n\nThough it is at a very early stage in its design, Sofi seems to do what it is supposed to. It allows you to design UIs in Python while leveraging web technologies like Bootstrap to render them. One thing I did not like about Sofi was the imperative nature of the UI design which reminded me of jQuery (and maybe a bit of Java AWT). After my experience with React, I wanted something declarative and functional.\nSo, is it possible to leverage websockets to implement something that keeps the general idea behind Sofi, but is declarative and functional like React?\nflybywire\nflybywire is my ongoing experiment based on Sofi to create a more declarative UI library. It re-renders the page every time the state changes. It uses a virtual-dom system similar to that used by React, to only update those parts of the page that have actually changed. The coding style in flybywire applications was modeled after that of React. The library includes a helper function that allows components to be defined in a syntax inspired by JSX.\nUsage\nBelow is a really simple demo app that is included with the library:\nA simple counter app made using flybywire\nAnd this is counter.py.\nfrom flybywire.core import App  \nfrom flybywire.dom import h\n\ndef CounterView(count):  \n    \"\"\"A simple functional stateless component.\"\"\"  \n    return h('h1', str(count))\n\nclass CounterApp(App):  \n    def \\_\\_init\\_\\_(self):  \n        \"\"\"Initialize the application.\"\"\"  \n        super().\\_\\_init\\_\\_()  \n        self.set\\_initial\\_state(0)\n\ndef render(self):  \n        \"\"\"Renders view given application state.\"\"\"  \n        return h('div',  \n                    \\[CounterView(count=self.state),  \n                     h('button', '+', onclick = self.increment),  \n                     h('button', '-', onclick = self.decrement)\\]  \n                )\n\ndef increment(self, e):  \n        \"\"\"Increments counter.\"\"\"  \n        self.set\\_state(self.state + 1)\n\ndef decrement(self, e):  \n        \"\"\"Decrements counter.\"\"\"  \n        self.set\\_state(self.state - 1)\n\napp = CounterApp()  \napp.start()\n\nHow it&nbsp;Works\nThe structure of the code above should be very familiar to anyone who has worked with React before. flybywire provides a helper function for building DOM structures. It is also possible to compose the UI out of stateless, functional components (like CounterView in the above example). This DOM structure is then converted into JSON format and sent to the browser over websockets using the autobahn library. The javascript part of the library parses the virtual-DOM structure out of the JSON data and patches the existing DOM wherever it has changed. Any DOM event callbacks are also setup to be passed back to the Python app over websockets.\nSome of the core parts of this library such as the event server and event processor were directly taken from Sofi with a few modifications. Instead of Bootstrap-based widgets, flybywire allows you to define your own components that can be composed to form whatever widget you need.\nIt is now possible to make some really simple apps using flybywire. However, the library is at a very early stage, given that the First Commit in the repository was only three days ago!\nWhat doesn’t&nbsp;work\nHere’s some things that are missing and/or acts weird:\n\nSome basic manipulations of the DOM elements such as focusing a particular input box or clearing the input box after a certain action is completed are currently not possible. This will probably require putting back some of the command system from Sofi that I had removed when making flybywire. This can also possibly be fixed by moving to a platform like Electron which may give greater control over the rendering process.\nThe server shuts down as soon as you close the browser window. This is done on purpose as there is currently no way to reset the application state without restarting the server. The shared state also results in weird behavior if you open multiple windows. Once we move to a platform like Electron, flybywire will have hopefully have more fine control over the life cycle of the application.\n\nComing Soon\nI will probably add a few more features over the weekend, particularly a better Component class for creating stateful components.

Though I have been thinking of blogging about my experience since the start, it didn’t really happen till now. I am currently wrapping up Project #3 — “Behavioral Cloning”. This one was considerably tougher than the first two. However, it has been very fulfilling to finally complete it and here I will describe the approach I used for training a neural network to drive a car (in a simulator).\n\nThe project description makes it looks easy (relatively). In the first project, we detected lanes using some basic Computer Vision methods and in the second, we classified traffic signs from the German Traffic Signs dataset. The third one seemed like an extension of the second, where instead of classifying traffic signs, we had to predict steering angles based on a camera feed, using a neural network.\nCollecting Training&nbsp;Data\nUnlike Project#2, this time we had to collect our own training data. This was more challenging than expected. As it turned out, controlling Udacity’s SDC simulator with a keyboard is not a simple task. Feedback from other students on Slack seemed to indicate that it also gave bad, jittery steering angle data. Fortunately, I have a friend who is crazy about car racing games and owns a Logitech G27 Racing wheel.\n\nUdacity’s SDC Simulator\nFor training data, I recorded data (“camera” images + steering angle and other telemetry) where I drove through the two tracks a couple of times. I also recorded data while recovering from deliberate perturbations to the sides of the lane to make sure the neural net also learned how to recover from such situations.\nPicking the Architecture and Training the&nbsp;NN\nI spent a lot of time experimenting with different convolutional neural network architectures, with varying levels of success. I also tried taking existing trained models like VGG16 and Google’s Inception v3 and adapting them to this purpose. Eventually, I settled upon NVIDIA’s End-to-End Deep Learning architecture described in this paper. It was relatively small in size and hence added very little latency when running it. I proceeded to use my gaming desktop with GTX 1070 GPU to train the model on ~32000 images.\nWhat I learned is that “mean square error” was not at all a predictor of the performance of the network in the actual simulator. Another big issue was the turnaround time between collecting data, training the network and then testing it. Also, the ‘remote driving’ script provided by Udacity set the car’s throttle to a constant value with no way to control the speed.\nThat is when I came across John Chen’s post on our Slack channel about how he developed an “Agile Trainer” to reduce the turnaround time between data-collection and testing. His program uses PyGame and Joystick input to manually takeover control from the neural network whenever it deviated too much and also allowed to train the network at the same time.\nI wrote my own live trainer based on this idea, which instead used keyboard input. It turned out that my keyboard based “remote driver” was able to control the simulator more reliably than the simulator’s “Training mode”.\nBest of all, it allowed me to fine-tune the model from my bed with my Macbook Pro by “NoMachine”-ing into my desktop (which would be difficult with a joystick/racing wheel).\nHow it&nbsp;works\nThe live trainer has a Tkinter-based UI and a few simple keyboard controls.\n\nSDC Live Trainer interface\nUp/Down: Control cruise speed\nLeft/Right: Steering\nx: Toggle between autonomous and manual override modes\nc: Center steering (only in manual override mode)\nz: Toggle real-time training (only in manual override mode)\nThe speed of the car is controlled by a proportional-gain controller. It modulates the throttle based on speed feedback. This rudimentary “cruise control” gets the speed within +/- 1 mph of the target speed, which is good enough in this case.\nThe arrow keys increase/decrease the steering angle. The steering also has some slow auto re-centering dynamics added by the trainer. So the steering angle will keep “decaying” towards zero if you don’t press any key. The “autonomous rating” measures what percentage of the current session was spent in fully autonomous mode.\nReal-time training\nThe process of training itself is pretty simple. You can do one of two things:\n\nDeliberately perturb the car’s motion while in manual override and engage training mode once you have started the recovery process\nAt any spots that the model has trouble with, engage training mode while driving through the spot manually to fine-tune the model.\n\nThe GIF below shows an example of the first case. I purposely drive the car towards the right edge using manual override and then start training the model once I have it recovering and returning to the center of the lane.\nEvaluating model performance\nMy initial model had some trouble navigating a couple of turns on track#1 in the simulator. I was able to successfully tune these spots using live training and finally get this result:\nTrack 2 was a little more difficult, with more sharp gradients and curves. However, I found that decreasing the speed down to 20 mph helped it navigate that track as well!\nThe live trainer code is on Github at: thomasantony/sdc-live-trainer\nPossibilities\nA live trainer can also probably be used to perform the initial training of the network, though that would involve a lot more baby-sitting during the training process. The good thing is that you can immediately start seeing results as the model converges toward the right weights.\nIs such an architecture extendable to real-world SDCs? It can definitely be done with scale models on scale tracks. On real cars it is probably a little more difficult (though there are probably ways to do it). NVIDIA’s paper mentions using real-world data to make a simulator. A live training methodology like the one described here can possibly be incorporated into such a simulator as well!\nLet me know if you have any comments/suggestions!\n","id":"https://thomasantony.com/posts/2016/tantony-training-a-neural-network-in-real-time-to-control-a-self-driving-car-9ee5654978b7/","title":"Training a neural network in real-time to control a self-driving car"},"https://thomasantony.com/posts/2018/":{"body":"","id":"https://thomasantony.com/posts/2018/","title":""},"https://thomasantony.com/posts/2018/tantony-using-virtualcan-inside-docker-on-macos-cfa10f7e75d6/":{"body":"At SmartAg, we use Docker to manage the development and runtime environments for our embedded software. For performing full-system integrated tests, we have built comprehensive simulators that mimic the behavior of the hardware that we automate. Since most of the hardware communication happens over CAN, VirtualCAN is a great way of faking the hardware signals.\n\nUntil now, any code that required a CAN interface could not run on my Macbook Pro. This was primarily because the linux kernel used by Docker for Mac lacks support for SocketCAN or VirtualCAN. After much head-bashing, I realized that a better option would be [docker-machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/)&nbsp;, which is how docker was originally run on macOS before the official “Docker for Mac” release.\nSetting up a CAN-enabled docker-machine VM\n\nInstall Homebrew if you don’t already have it.\nInstall docker, docker-machine and some associated software\n\nbrew install docker docker-compose docker-machine docker-credential-helper docker-machine-driver-xhyve\n3. Clone the repo from https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker\n4. Edit kernel_config in the boot2docker repo and add the following at the bottom:\nCONFIG\\_CAN=y  \nCONFIG\\_CAN\\_RAW=y  \nCONFIG\\_CAN\\_VCAN=y  \nCONFIG\\_CAN\\_DEV=y  \nCAN\\_SLCAN=y  \nCAN\\_BCM=y\n\n5. Follow the instructions at https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/blob/master/doc/BUILD.md to build your custom boot2docker image. This basically boils down to:\ndocker build -t boot2docker .  \ndocker run --rm boot2docker &gt; boot2docker-can.iso\n\n6. Fix some permissions required by the xhyve docker-machine driver.\nsudo chown root:wheel $(brew --prefix)/opt/docker-machine-driver-xhyve/bin/docker-machine-driver-xhyve  \nsudo chmod u+s $(brew --prefix)/opt/docker-machine-driver-xhyve/bin/docker-machine-driver-xhyve\n\n7. Create your new docker-machine VM with the following command. Change the command appropriately to allocate the desired number of CPUs, amount of RAM and disk space to the VM.\ndocker-machine create default --driver xhyve --xhyve-experimental-nfs-share --xhyve-cpu-count=4 --xhyve-memory-size=4096 --xhyve-disk-size=40000 --xhyve-boot2docker-url boot2docker-can.iso\n\n8. Your docker-machine VM is now ready. It should already be running. If you restart your machine, you can start the VM by typing docker-machine start default or stop it with docker-machine stop default&nbsp;.\n9. Set the environment parameters to use docker with your new VM by running eval $(docker-machine env default)&nbsp;. This command has to be run every time you are in a new terminal. You can also add this to your&nbsp;.bashrc to make it automatic.\n10. Check that it all works:\ndocker run -it --rm --privileged alpine /bin/sh\n\nInside the docker container, run:\nzcat /proc/config.gz | grep CAN\n\nThe command should display the CAN flags that you set while compiling the kernel. SocketCAN/VirtualCAN is now enabled in any docker container that you start on this VM.\nCaveats\nRunning docker using docker-machine means that some things, such as port-forwarding does not work as you expect. A handy script for exposing any ports you want from your VM to localhost can be found here: https://github.com/johanhaleby/docker-machine-port-forwarder\n","id":"https://thomasantony.com/posts/2018/tantony-using-virtualcan-inside-docker-on-macos-cfa10f7e75d6/","title":"Using VirtualCAN inside docker on macOS"},"https://thomasantony.com/posts/2019/":{"body":"","id":"https://thomasantony.com/posts/2019/","title":""},"https://thomasantony.com/posts/2019/hello-world/":{"body":"8/8/2020 update: I have imported some of my older articles from Medium to this blog to consolidate everything in one spot.

This post documents how to get an Orbiter 2016 addon development environment set-up on Windows 10, using tools available today (in 2020).\nDownload Orbiter 2016\nDownload and install Orbiter following instructions at http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/download.html. \"TexFilms\" on Youtube has a very good video detailing how to install Orbiter 2016 along with some essential add-ons. Orbiter-Forum is also a great resource. The rest of the post assumes that Orbiter 2016 is installed in C:\\Orbiter.\nDownload Visual Studio 2019\nDownload the Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition web installer from Visual Studio Download Center. Run the installer and you will eventually see a window with something similar to this:\n\nCheck the option that says \"Desktop Development with C++\". You may also modify the install location for the compiler. Continue with the installation and wait for it to complete.\nBuild a sample project\nThe Orbiter SDK is installed in C:\\Orbiter\\OrbiterSdk. The SDK includes some sample projects including custom vehicles and Multi-Functional Displays (MFDs). Open OrbiterSdk\\CustomMFD\\CustomMFD.vcproj in Visual Studio 2019. You will get a prompt asking you if you want to convert the project to make it compatible.\n\nClick \"OK\" to continue. Switch to the \"Property Manager\" tab at the bottom of \"Solution Explorer\".\n\nWithin Property Manager, expand \"CustomMFD\" to show two options \"Debug | WIn32\" and \"Release | Win32\". Expand both of these until you get an opton called \"Orbiterroot\". Right click this and select Properties. \n\nSelect \"User Macros\". Ensure that the \"OrbiterDir\" variable is set to the correct Orbiter installation path.\n\nSelect \"VC++ Directories\". Change the \"Include Directories\" and \"Library Directories\" settings as shown in the screenshow below. This will ensure that the compiler can find the Orbiter SDK header files and libraries.\n\nClick \"OK\" to close the property pages window. Right click on \"CustomMFD\" in Property Manager and select \"Properties\". This should give you a window with an additional setting called \"Debugging\". Change the settings as shown in the screenshot below. Please note that I use C:\\Orbiter\\Orbiter_ng.exe as the \"Command\" setting because I have the Orbiter D3D9Client installed. If you are running a vanilla Orbiter installation, set this to C:\\Orbiter\\Orbiter.exe instead.\n\nI got this handy tip from Andrew Stokes' video. Go to C++ &gt; Code Generation in the Property Sheet. Change Runtime Library to \"Multithreaded (/MT)\" for your \"Release\" configuration and \"Multithreaded Debug (/MTd)\" for your \"Debug\" configuration. This removes an external dependency on Visual Studio Runtime DLL.\n\n\nAt this point, if you hit Build (F7), you may get an error saying:\nRC : fatal error RC1110: could not open CustomMFD.rc\n\nIf this happens, switch back to \"Solution Explorer\" and delete the CustomMFD.rc file. Now the project should build successfully. It should be noted that the compiler places the output in the C:\\Orbiter\\Modules\\Plugin directory by default. This can be verified by deleting C:\\Orbiter\\Modules\\Plugin\\CustomMFD.dll and rebuilding the project. Ensure that CustomMFD.dll appears in the folder after you build the project. You can now run Orbiter as usual or have Visual Studio start it for you by hitting \"Debug\". Activate the Module within Orbiter Launcher as shown below to test it in the simulator.\n\nYour development environment is now ready.\n","id":"https://thomasantony.com/posts/2020/orbiter-sdk-vs-2019/","title":"Setting up the Orbiter 2016 SDK in Visual Studio 2019"},"https://thomasantony.com/posts/2021/":{"body":"","id":"https://thomasantony.com/posts/2021/","title":""},"https://thomasantony.com/posts/2021/msl-apollo-guidance/":{"body":"\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nThis post is a companion to the video linked above and includes a full derivation of the Apollo entry guidance longitudinal control algorithm. Please watch the video for more context. Full source code of Jupyter notebooks implementing the algorithm can be found at thomasantony/msl-apollo-entry-guidance.\nNASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission showcased an advancement in entry technology that allowed it to land much closer to its designated landing site than previous missions. It used with great success, the same guidance algorithm originally used by the Apollo Command Module when returning from the moon. By modulating its lift vector, MSL was able to counteract errors in its trajectory during hypersonic flight and combined with the famous \"sky-crane\" maneuver, deliver the Curiosity rover to within 2.5 km of its targeted landing site next to Gale Crater. Last year's Mars 2020 mission used the same guidance system to successfully land the Perseverance rover within Jezero crater.\nApollo Guidance Algorithm Overview\nThe goal of the Apollo guidance algorithm is to minimize the error in \"range\" along the ground when compared to that of a pre-computed reference trajectory. It does not try to exactly match the reference trajectory, but instead computes a constant bank angle that is supposed to minimize the downrange distance error at the point where the vehicle reaches terminal altitude. This computation is repeated several times a second in the same manner as a closed-loop control system to correct for deviations in the trajectory due to external or internal factors.\nThe guidance algorithm uses bank angle to control the amount of vertical lift. This has the side-effect of causing lateral motion that takes the spacecraft away from the desired path. In order to account for this, the bank angle commanded is reversed when the predicted cross-range error exceeds a certain amount, effectively creating a series of S-turns. This is similar to the S-turns performed by the Space Shuttle during its re-entry.\nThis article focuses on the downrange error control.\n2DOF Dynamic Model\nThe MSL entry vehicle is modeled in two-dimensions using a vehicle-centric polar coordinate system. The state variables in the model are altidude ($h$), downrange distance ($s$), speed ($v$) and flight path angle($\\gamma$). Their equations of motion are as follows:\n\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\frac{d h}{dt} &amp;= v \\sin{\\gamma} \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\frac{d s}{dt} &amp;= v \\cos{\\gamma}  \\\\\n    \\frac{d v}{dt} &amp;= -{{D/m}} - {{g}} \\sin(\\gamma)  \\\\\n    \\frac{d \\gamma}{dt} &amp;= \\frac{1}{v} \\left(\\frac{v^2 \\cos(\\gamma)}{{{R_M}} + h} + \\frac{L \\cos{u}}{m} - {{g}}\\cos(\\gamma)\\right) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere \n\n    $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{D}{m} &amp;= \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2 \\beta} &amp;;&amp; \\text{ Drag Acceleration}\\\\\n\\frac{L}{m} &amp;= \\frac{D}{m}\\enspace (L/D) &amp;;&amp;\\text{ Lift Acceleration}\\\\\n\\nonumber\\\\\n\\rho &amp;= \\rho_0 e^{-h/H} &amp;;&amp; \\text{ Atmosphere Model}\\\\\n\\nonumber\\\\\n\\beta &amp;= 120 \\text{kg/m$^2$} &amp;;&amp; \\text{ Ballistic Coefficient} \\\\\n(L/D) &amp;= 0.24 &amp;;&amp;\\text{ Lift-to-Drag Ratio}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSurface atmospheric density, $\\rho_0$ and scale height, $H$ define the exponential atmospheric model. $g$ is a constant value for acceleration due to gravity. $u$ is the bank angle of the vehicle. The states are collectively referred to as $\\mathbf{x}$. The equations of motions may be collectively referred to as $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}, u, t)$.\nDeriving the Apollo Entry Guidance Algorithm\nNote on the Variation Operator\nThis derivation requires the use of the \"variation operator\", denoted by $\\delta$, sometimes called a functional derivative or variational derivative. A functional is a function that acts on functions. For example, $J(y(t))$ is a functional because $y$ is itself a function of time. Here $J$ is a scalar quantity derived from a function $y(t)$, that essentially consists of an infinite number of points. \nThe variational operator is to functionals, what derivatives are to functions. Similar to how a stationary point of a function can be found by setting its derivative to zero, the stationary point of a functional can be found by setting its variation to zero. \nPlease check the following links if you want to learn more:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqDHO2eKXcs\nhttps://canvas.vt.edu/files/1315932/download?download_frd=1\nDeriving bank angle policy\n\nThe goal is to find the constant bank angle $u$ that will guide the spacecraft from the perturbed starting state $\\mathbf{x_0}$ to the same range as the reference trajectory. Let's call this function $J$. Any variable with an \"f\" in the suffix denotes that it is evaluated at the terminal point of the trajectory and the '*' denotes that it is part of the reference trajectory.\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\nJ = R_f &amp;= s_f + \\dot{s_f} dt_f = s_f + v_f \\cos(\\gamma_f)  dt_f \\label{eqn:J_1}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nFrom the equations of motion,\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\dot{h_f} &amp;= \\frac{dh_f}{dt_f} \\implies dt_f = \\frac{dh_f}{\\dot{h_f}} \\label{eqn:h_f_expr}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nSubstituting $\\eqref{eqn:h_f_expr}$ in $\\eqref{eqn:J_1}$,\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\nJ &amp;= s_f + \\frac{v_f \\cos(\\gamma_f) }{\\dot{h_f}} dh_f \\\\ \n &amp;= s_f + \\frac{v_f \\cos(\\gamma_f)}{v_f \\sin(\\gamma_f)} dh_f\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nAssuming that the reference trajectory terminates at the ground, we get $dh_f = 0 - h_f = -h_f$\n\n    $$\n\\implies J = s_f - cot(\\gamma_f) h_f = \\Phi(\\mathbf{x}_f)\n$$\n\nWe want to now find a constant value of $u$ that will keep J constant at $J = R_f = R_f^*$ even with perturbations. We are able to control the trajectory by influencing $u$ and are constrained by physics i.e. equations of motion, $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x},u,t)$. These constraints can be adjoined to $J$ using co-states $\\mathbf{\\lambda}^\\intercal = \\left[\\lambda_h\\enspace\\lambda_s\\enspace\\lambda_v\\enspace\\lambda_\\gamma\\right]$, one for each state. This is very similar to Lagrange multipliers used in function optimization.

However this can be very expensive (especially considering the hardware this was originally designed for). So we differentiate (34) w.r.t $t_0$ and apply Leibniz Rule to get\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial \\lambda_u}{\\partial t_0} &amp;= -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}^\\intercal \\mathbf{\\lambda}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThe boundary condition for $\\lambda_u$ can be obtained as :\n\n    $$\n\\lambda_u(t_0=t_f) = \\int_{t_f}^{t_f}-\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}^\\intercal \\mathbf{\\lambda}\\enspace dt = 0\n$$\n\nApollo Guidance Bank Angle Policy\nWhen we actually implement this guidance algorithm, $t_0$ and $\\mathbf{\\mathbf{x}_0}$ corresponds to the \"current\" time and state of the spacecraft. All the $\\delta{\\mathbf{x}}$ values are therefore computed by comparing the current trajectory to the reference trajectory. For example, \n$\\delta h(v_0) = h(v_0) - h^{*}(v_0)$ \nwhere $h(v_0)$ is the current altitude and $h^*(v_0)$ is the altitude on the reference trajectory corresponding to the current speed. \nPutting it all together, $\\eqref{eqn:delu_1}$ becomes\n\n    $$\n\\delta u =  -\\frac{\\frac{-H\\lambda_h^*(v_0)}{(D/m)^*(v_0)}\\delta((D/m) (v_0)) + \\lambda_s^*(v_0) \\delta s(v_0) +  \\frac{\\lambda_\\gamma^*(v_0)}{v_0^* \\cos{(\\gamma(v_0))}}\\delta\\dot{h}(v_0)}{\\lambda_u^*(v_0)}\n$$\n\nThe terms containing $*$ can be pre-computed on the ground along with teh reference trajectory. These terms can therefore be substituted by:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\nF_1(v_0) &amp;= \\frac{H \\lambda_h^*(v_0)}{\\frac{D}{m}^*(v_0)}\\\\\nF_2(v_0) &amp;= \\frac{\\lambda_\\gamma^*(v_0)}{v_0^* \\cos{\\gamma^*(v_0)}} \\\\\nF_3(v_0) &amp;= \\lambda_u^*(v_0)\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nAlso, it can be found that $\\lambda_s$ has a constant value of 1 since $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{s}}{\\partial s} = 0$ and $\\lambda_s(t_f) = 1$. \nSo the final expression for $\\delta u$ becomes:\n\n    $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\delta u =  \\frac{- \\delta s(v_0) -F_1(v_0) \\delta(\\frac{D}{m} (v_0))  - F_2 (v_0) \\delta\\dot{h}(v_0)}{F_3(v_0)}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n$\\delta u$ is added to the reference bank angle $u$ to obtain the bank angle to be commanded in each guidance cycle.\nSome Notes on Implementation\nOne key bottleneck that I found during implementation was the data-lookup within the reference trajectory data. Right now, the reference trajectory data is stored in a 2D numpy array. In every guidance cycle, we do a lookup within this array to find the data row with the closest value of velocity to the vehicle's current velocity. This could be made much more efficient with a better data structure.\nConclusion\nThe Jupyter notebooks implement the algorithm as well as a Monte Carlo simulation system for testing it. I will be updating them to add more notes and details on the implementation to clarify things further.\nReferences\n[1] R.D.Braun and R.M.

I previously took a stab at this back in 2020 with limited success. I was much less knowledgeable about Rust at the time and the tooling around C++ bindings were not as mature then. This post is a companion to this new repository that contains a proof-of-concept for building a spacecraft addon for Orbiter in Rust.\nWhy Rust?\nRust is a relatively new high level systems programming language with a focus on safety. Orbiter is written in C++ and therefore its addons are also typically written in C++. Rust development for Orbiter is facilitated using the cxx crate.\nDesign\nThe repository in its current form produces a DLL file as its build artifact that can be loaded into Orbiter as an addon module. Anyone wanting to create a Rust addon will clone/fork the repository and build it along with the the Rust code for their addon.(See update below). \nThere are a limited number of Orbiter SDK functions currently available as Rust bindings in this prototype.\nThis will expand in the future to hopefully encompass the majority of the API. The repository includes a demo addon that models NASA's Surveyor probe. This follows from the C++ tutorial at OrbiterWiki and implements retro-thruster staging and differential thrust attitude control.\nDeveloping custom spacecraft addons\nUpdate 01/11/2022: This section has been changed to reflect changes to the crate\nAll the spacecraft-specific code in the repository lives in its own file (src/shuttle_pb.rs for example).\nAn addon crate implementing a spacecraft should import the orbiter_rs crate. It should then set its crate-type to cdylib. \n[package]\nname = \"shuttlepb\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"Thomas Antony\"]\nedition = \"2018\"\n\n[lib]\ncrate-type = [\"cdylib\"]\n\n[dependencies]\norbiter_rs = { version = \"0.1\", path = \"/path/to/orbiter-rs\" }\n\nThe crate should then have a lib.rs containing a struct that implements the OrbiterVessel trait. It should then use the init_vessel macro as shown below. This macro generates a stub that is links the Rust code to the OrbiterSDK. For example, in lib.rs:\nuse orbiter_rs::{\n    ODebug, OrbiterVessel, VesselContext, _V, init_vessel, FileHandle\n};\n\n#[derive(Default, Debug)]\npub struct ShuttlePB {\n    _some_param: i32\n}\n\nimpl OrbiterVessel for ShuttlePB {\n    fn set_class_caps(&amp;mut self, context: &amp;VesselContext, _cfg: FileHandle) {\n        context.SetSize(1.0);\n        context.SetPMI(_V!(0.50, 0.50, 0.50));\n        context.AddMesh(\"ShuttlePB\".to_string());\n    }\n}\n\ninit_vessel!(\n    fn init(_h_vessel: OBJHANDLE, _flight_model: i32) -&gt; ShuttlePB\n    {\n        ShuttlePB::default()\n    }\n    fn exit() {}\n);\n\nThe addon may use any of the wrapped functions currently available. Any other Orbiter SDK functions will require wrappers to be generated for them. An automated tool like autocxx may be worth investigating for this purpose.\nBuilding and Installing\nThe addon can be built using cargo build assuming that Visual Studio 2019 is available. Other C++ compilers may or may not work. Deploying the addon also requires a config file and any meshes and other dependencies. An example can be seen in Config/Surveyor.cfg. Once you build the addon, the DLL will be available in the target/i686-pc-windows-msvc/debug folder. This will need to be renamed to match whatever module name you haev in the configuration file.\nSummary\nThis proof-of-concept gives a basic framework for building Orbiter addons in Rust. It is not a complete system by any metric and will require significant amounts of work before it can be considered that.\n","id":"https://thomasantony.com/posts/orbiter-addon-rust/","title":"Orbiter Addon Development in Rust"},"https://thomasantony.com/publications/":{"body":"Journal Articles and Conference Proceedings\n\n\nRapid Indirect Trajectory Optimization on Highly Parallel Computing Architectures\nAntony, T., and Grant, M.
