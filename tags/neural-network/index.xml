Though I have been thinking of blogging about my experience since the start, it didn’t really happen till now. I am currently wrapping up Project #3 — “Behavioral Cloning”. This one was considerably tougher than the first two. However, it has been very fulfilling to finally complete it and here I will describe the approach I used for training a neural network to drive a car (in a simulator).</description></item></channel></rss>
