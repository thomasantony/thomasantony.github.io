Hey everyone,

I am Thomas Antony --- a Masters (soon to be PhD) student in Aeronautics & Astronautics at [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu "Purdue University"). I work on some really cool (in my opionion, anyway) trajectory optimization stuff at [RDSL](https://engineering.purdue.edu/RDSL/ "Rapid Design of Systems Laboratory"). This is my personal blog + academic profile/CV website. 

My work is very computer science centric, but also includes a lot of aerospace engineering. I am also planning to have a web-based version of my trajectory solver on this website, sometime in the near future. 

I am currently seeking summer/semester internships in aerospace and related fields. Take a look at my <a markdown="0" href="{{ site.url }}/resume">resume</a> if you are interested in hiring me.
